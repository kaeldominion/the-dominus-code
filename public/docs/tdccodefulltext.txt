THE DOMINUS CODE


Fuck Monogamy. Build a Dynasty.

Foreword: Read This First
I’m not here to sell a fantasy. I’ve lived too many of them already. I’ve had the money, the women, the cars, the clubs, the applause. I’ve woken up in penthouses I don’t remember walking into, with people I barely knew, pretending I was living the dream.
This book came from the silence after the noise, the mornings when I’d sit alone and realise how little of it meant anything. The success, the chaos, the constant motion, it all looked powerful from the outside, but I was running from something real: responsibility. Legacy. The idea that maybe a man isn’t supposed to chase freedom his whole life, but build something worth being bound to.
I do not have children yet. That is my greatest regret. This book is not just a record of the life I’ve lived; it is the manifesto for the one I am building. It is the framework to ensure I stop drifting and finally pursue the Prime Directive.
I didn’t plan to write this. It started as notes to myself, things I needed to remember. Lessons from my father, from failure, from women who saw through my bullshit and still loved me anyway. Somewhere along the line, those notes turned into a code. Not a philosophy. A framework. Something a man can live by when everything around him is built to make him weaker.
I know how this sounds. 'Another guy writing about masculinity.' But this isn’t theory. It is scar tissue. It is the raw data collected from decades of winning, losing, and rebuilding. I didn’t learn this from legends; I learned it from the stark reality of the market and the honest feedback of women who refused to settle for less than my best. The Code isn’t about dominance for its own sake, it’s about structure, order, and purpose. It’s about building a world where your children don’t have to start from zero.
When I say Dominus, I don’t mean overlord. I don’t refer to myself as Dominus and demand my girlfriends call me that. What I mean is leader. Protector. The one who carries the weight. The one who bleeds first so others don’t have to. People forget that’s what strength was meant for. Not control, but for direction. Without direction, even strength decays.
I’ve seen what happens when men lose that sense of duty. They drift. They collapse into comfort. They outsource their instincts to a culture that tells them to apologize for being who they are. They stop leading. And when men stop leading, families fall apart. Nations follow.
I’m not here to convince anyone. If you think devotion is slavery, or structure is oppression, this book isn’t for you. If you think freedom means doing whatever you want, whenever you want, good luck, you’ll learn soon enough that chaos doesn’t love you back.
What I’m building, what we are building, isn’t rebellion. It’s restoration. A return to hierarchy, purpose, polarity. The masculine and feminine as they were meant to be, complementary, not competitive. The Dominus and his Deae. Not in chains, but in alignment.
I’ve seen both sides. I’ve seen women who crave leadership but are too afraid to admit it. I’ve seen men who crave purpose but have been told it’s toxic. Both end up lost, chasing pleasure because it’s easier than meaning. That’s the real sickness of our time, pleasure without purpose, comfort without consequence.
At the core of everything you are about to read lies an ancient, unyielding truth we have forgotten.
Life’s Prime Directive is not pleasure.
It is not happiness. It is not the endless pursuit of the next experience.
The Prime Directive is this: To strengthen your bloodline. To honour those who came before you. To build for those who come after you.
Modernity, soft, confused, and addicted to dopamine, has forgotten this directive and is now on its knees. It has taught you that happiness is the goal. But happiness is not found in indulgence. It is found in discipline, in building, and in sacrifice for something greater than oneself.
Pleasure chases itself into oblivion. Purpose sharpens itself into an empire.
There’s a line I keep coming back to: To move the world, you must first move yourself. That’s it. That’s the core. Before you can build a family, a business, a legacy, you have to conquer your own chaos. You have to become a man your bloodline would be proud of.
Every story in these pages is real. Some names changed, some details softened, but the lessons are carved into me. Life moves fast, and the Code is a filter. Some of the people mentioned in these chapters are still by my side; others could not hold the pace and fell away. That doesn’t make the history false; it confirms the rigor of the standard. You’ll see the mistakes, the arrogance, the women I hurt, the empires I built and burned. You’ll see what it takes to rebuild when everything falls apart. You’ll see what it means to carry the weight, willingly.
This isn’t a self-help book. I’m not interested in helping you feel better. I’m interested in helping you remember who you are. The world doesn’t need more happy men. It needs strong ones. Men who understand that love and duty aren’t separate things. That a woman’s devotion is earned through his structure, not demanded through his ego.
I’ve been called arrogant, controlling, old-fashioned. Fine. Words don’t build families. Actions do. And if that means standing against a culture that worships weakness, then so be it. I’d rather be hated for protecting something real than applauded for watching it burn.
I don’t expect everyone to understand this. Most won’t. Some will read it and feel something stir, a memory, a longing, a quiet voice that’s been buried under years of noise. That’s who I wrote it for. The men who know there’s more to life than comfort. The women who still believe in devotion, not as submission, but as strength.
This isn’t about control. It’s about order. It’s about love with teeth. Family with spine. Discipline with heart.
I built this Code because I needed it. Maybe you do too.

Manifesto: The Dominus Code
A Manifesto of Power, Polarity, and Legacy
Everything started breaking quietly. Men stopped leading. Women stopped trusting. Children grew up with screens instead of fathers. The structure that once held families together slipped into dust while everyone called it progress. You can’t build anything lasting on that.
The Dominus Code exists to rebuild from that place. It’s a way of living for men who refuse to drift. No slogans. No theories. Just the steady truth that strength and love belong together, and that both fall apart when separated.
A man’s life means something when he creates stability. When he can hold tension without collapsing. When his presence gives direction to the people around him. That’s the centre of it all.
The Code
The Code lives in the body before it lives in the mind. It starts with how you breathe, train, rest, speak, move, decide. It shapes the way you handle money, women, and time. It rewards consistency. It punishes hesitation.
Each day built on repetition until discipline becomes peace.
The Code moves outward. A man who governs himself can protect others. A man who protects others builds legacy. That’s the pattern. The outer world mirrors the inner one.
Polarity gives it direction. The masculine provides stability, the feminine gives life movement and warmth. Together they make the world worth protecting.
The Masculine Standard
The masculine standard begins with presence. A man who has it doesn’t need to announce himself. His actions line up with his words. His decisions aren’t guided by moods. He does what needs doing whether anyone is watching or not.
Discipline shapes his edges. He learns to channel aggression into precision. He doesn’t react to noise. He keeps his circle close and his mission clear.
People rely on him because they feel calmer when he’s around. He isn’t perfect, but he’s consistent. When he fails, he adjusts. When he’s tested, he holds. That steadiness becomes its own language.
Women and Devotion
A woman opens fully when she feels safe in a man’s direction. Safety doesn’t mean comfort. It means trust in his capacity. She can rest when she knows he won’t drift.
When that happens, her energy changes everything around her. She softens the edges of the home, brings beauty to the struggle, turns effort into meaning. Her presence multiplies what he builds.
The Code honours that dynamic. It teaches men to be worthy of devotion, not entitled to it. To create the structure where the feminine can flourish without fear. That harmony is what gives strength purpose.
Blood and Legacy
Legacy shows in small things. The way a son carries himself. The patience in a daughter’s eyes. The tone inside a home that has direction.
Modern life turned family into an accessory. Something to do after ambition is finished. But the work never finishes. The Code reminds men that fatherhood is the project. Everything else fits around that.
A man who raises strong children secures eternity in his name. His discipline becomes their inheritance. His love becomes their backbone. That’s how bloodlines strengthen.
The Dominus Way
A Dominus leads quietly. He doesn’t need a stage. His authority grows from steadiness, not noise. He doesn’t command people into trust; they follow because they can feel he won’t break when things get hard.
He protects, provides, and builds. He listens more than he speaks. He makes decisions that carry weight, and when they go wrong, he owns them. His calmness becomes an anchor for others.
That’s real leadership. Not control. Not performance. Just order held long enough for others to find their place in it.
The Return
The Dominus Code isn’t a throwback. It’s a rebuilding. The old world taught men to conquer, the new one tells them to apologize. Both missed the point. The Code sits between them — a call to build something functional, honest, and strong.
This return won’t come from politics or movements. It’ll come from individual men doing the hard work of alignment. From families that stand firm. From women who choose trust over fear. From children who grow up seeing what love looks like with structure behind it.
The future belongs to builders.

Prologue: The Rise of the Dominus
I didn’t wake up one day and decide to become “Dominus.” You don’t choose a title like that; you are dragged into it by necessity.
It wasn’t a grand moment of enlightenment under a waterfall. It was a slow, brutal erosion of bullshit. A gradual stripping away of everything I thought mattered—the applause, the girls, the noise, the ego—until only the essentials were left: strength, order, and peace.
To understand the Code, you have to understand the chaos that birthed it.
In my twenties, I was a burning fuse. I chased everything at once: business, women, status. I built fast and broke faster. I was running on a mixture of high intellect and low wisdom, convinced that if I just moved quickly enough, I could outrun my own lack of structure.
I went from sleeping in offices and blagging my way into boardrooms in the UK, to exiting for millions, and landing straight into the neon-soaked skyline of Shanghai.
Shanghai was the fire. That city has a pulse like a defibrillator: fast, unforgiving, full of predators who smile while they hunt. I became the Music Director of M1NT, the most exclusive club in the city. I was driving a Rolls Royce Ghost, drinking until sunrise, and standing on stages with thousands of people screaming my name .
On paper, I was a god. In reality, I was hollowing out.
I was living the life every modern man is told to want. I had the women—endless, beautiful, interchangeable. I had the status. I had the access. But I felt like a ghost in my own life. I was soaking up applause I felt I hadn't earned, masking my imposter syndrome with another bottle of vodka.
I could command a room, but I couldn’t command myself. I was reactive. Emotional. Impatient. I told myself it was "passion." Really, it was chaos disguised as drive .
I watched men older than me in those clubs, still chasing attention like teenagers, their faces puffy with excess, their eyes scanning the room for the next hit of dopamine. I saw my future in them, and it terrified me.
The shift didn't happen in a boardroom. It happened in the silence after the noise.
It happened on mornings in Bali, waking up hungover in a villa that cost a fortune, realising I hadn’t done a single thing that strengthened my bloodline. I saw the women I cared about drifting away, not because I wasn't "fun," but because I wasn't safe. I wasn't consistent enough to be trusted.
I realised that Power without Structure is just a leak.
I made a decision. December 31st, 2020. No fireworks. No party. Just a quiet, violent commitment to kill the boy so the man could breathe .
I stopped drinking. Not for a month. Forever. It wasn’t a moral choice; it was a mechanical one. I needed to remove the variable that caused the drift .
Then, I started to build. Not a business, but a system.
I replaced dopamine with discipline. I replaced the late nights with early mornings. I replaced the chaotic pursuit of women with a structure that allowed the feminine to rest. I stopped trying to be "interesting" and started trying to be "effective."
The gym became a ritual. Food became fuel. Time became currency.
As the structure hardened, something strange happened. The noise stopped. The anxiety evaporated. The need to perform vanished.
In its place came Gravity.
That is when the Dominus emerged. Not as a persona I put on like a suit, but as the natural consequence of alignment.
When a man leads himself with absolute, unshakeable authority, the world reorganizes around him. Women feel safe because he does not flinch. Men respect him because he does not posture. Children learn from him because he does not lie.
I didn’t create the Dominus to escape the world. I became him to build one. To build a family. To build a compound. To build a dynasty that outlives my teeth.
This book is not a memoir of a party boy turned preacher. It is a technical manual for the reconstruction of the masculine soul.
It is for the men who know that "modern masculinity" is a scam. It is for the men who are tired of apologizing for their strength. It is for the men who want to stop chasing pleasure and start building an empire.
The climb starts here.
Welcome to the Code.

Chapter 1: The War on Men
I was born and lived in the UK until I was 29. Those were good years, mostly. I built a few businesses, had relationships, and thought I understood how the world worked. Then I moved to China, then Bali, then Dubai.
Coming back to Britain now? Fucking hell. Something died.
Not overnight. Slowly. Like watching a fire fade in the rain.
The men got softer. The women got harder. Everyone’s miserable but no one can say why. And if you try to point it out, you’re the problem.
I’m not some nostalgia merchant pining for the 1950s. I’m talking about what I’ve seen. Couples who had everything: money, compatibility, shared values, but no spark. The woman’s closed off. Agitated. The man’s walking on eggshells in his own house.
He’s not abusive. He’s not absent. He’s just… uncertain. And that uncertainty? It’s killing everything.
I remember one couple. Mate of mine from university. Good guy. Loyal, kind, steady. Worked in finance, six figures easy. His girlfriend had her own career, independence, options. On paper, perfect.
At dinner parties in London, I’d watch her eyes drift. Not toward other men exactly, just… searching for something she couldn’t find in him anymore.
He hadn’t cheated or failed. He did everything the modern script tells men to do: emotionally available, supportive, “willing to work on it.”
But she was dying inside. You could see it.
Eventually she left. Not for someone richer or better looking. For a man who ran a small construction company. Made less money. Probably less educated. But he made decisions: fast, certain, without flinching.
“I still love him,” she told me about my mate. “But I can’t respect him.”
That line haunted me. Because it wasn’t about love. It never is. It was about polarity. When polarity dies, love doesn’t matter.
I saw it everywhere. Men trying to be everything women said they wanted: sensitive, communicative, while watching attraction vanish anyway. Because what women say they want and what their bodies respond to are two different languages.
Next came China. The contrast hit like a slap.
Roles were clearer. Not “old-fashioned”, just coherent. Women had immense power, but it was influence, not authority. They didn’t need to lead because the men hadn’t abdicated. Patriotism was alive.
It wasn’t perfect, but it worked. And in a world starving for clarity, coherence feels like safety.
When men lead with certainty, women don’t resist. They exhale.
Dubai took it further. Masculinity there wasn’t on trial, it was assumed. Men held the line; women moved around it with grace. Not submission. Synergy. That doesn’t mean there were not extremely successful and powerful women there. I’ve known many. But the exception doesn’t disprove the rule.
And here’s the truth soyboys dislike hearing: it works because they’re selective. You want in? Earn it. Contribute. You don’t get citizenship for existing. No handouts. No apologies. They protect what they’ve built.
Meanwhile, the UK flung the gates open; welcomed millions from cultures with entirely different values, handed them housing, benefits, votes, and now acts shocked when those votes protect their own interests, not Britain’s.
You can’t import values. Culture isn’t a hat. It’s generational.
Rome learned that too. The men who built it were disciplined, relentless, loyal to an ideal. But success softened them. Discipline decayed into decadence. They handed out citizenship to everyone, people with no loyalty to Roman blood or Roman gods. Those people voted for themselves, not for Rome. The empire didn’t collapse from invasion, it imploded from within.
Same pattern. Same outcome.
People don’t want to hear this, but beneath politics it’s just biology. The physics of polarity.
Attraction doesn’t grow in sameness; it feeds on difference. The feminine doesn’t want to wrestle for the reins. She longs to rest in masculine gravity.
But when a man steps back, hesitates, she steps forward. Not because she wants to, but because she has to. Nature abhors a vacuum.
And once she leads, something ancient in her shifts. Respect fades. Desire follows. What’s left isn’t love; it’s quiet resentment.
That’s our world now. Men trained not to lead. Women exhausted from pretending they want to.
If you’re reading this, you’ve felt it. You’ve seen that flicker in her eyes when you held back instead of stepping forward. You’ve watched your mates shrink inside their own homes. You’ve felt your instincts corrode under shame dressed up as progress.
Women don’t test to break you. They test to feel you.
Most men don’t get this. They call her emotional, irrational, difficult. But she’s searching, searching for the spine of a man who won’t collapse under her storm. And when she doesn’t find it, she steps into the void. Not because she wants to, but because someone must.
The moment she’s forced to lead is the moment respect begins to die.
I saw it again with another mate. Different couple, same tragedy. He was loyal, kind, dependable. The “dream.” And yet, time after time, I’d catch her looking for something. Not flirting. Just… a need for presence. The pulse of masculine gravity.
He hadn’t betrayed her. He just stopped leading. His steadiness turned static. His gentleness curdled into passivity.
When she left, she said, “I don’t need someone to take care of me. I need someone I can follow.”
That’s the line most modern men never hear. They lose attraction not because of what they do, but because of what they’ve stopped becoming.
A woman in Bali told me this over breakfast while we talked about this book.
She’d dated a man who, on paper, had it all: masculine, driven, articulate. Promised to build a life with her. But he couldn’t stop drinking.
Not violent, not reckless, just inconsistent. His mouth spoke structure, his actions whispered chaos.
“I wanted to surrender,” she said. “I wanted to trust. But every time he picked up that bottle, I stopped feeling safe.”
That’s the quiet killer. Discipline makes authority real. It’s the signal a woman reads subconsciously: “You’re safe here.” Without that signal, surrender dies. What replaces it is supervision.
The moment a woman feels she must supervise the man she hoped to follow, the relationship dies. Not with drama, but silence.
Now, this next bit will piss people off.
I fucking love Trump.
I know. But listen.
The man took a bullet, blood running down his face, fist raised, and kept moving forward. No tears. No press apology. No retreat. Just: fight.
That’s masculinity under pressure. Not flawless, not polished—just real. Defiant. Alive.
Does he say stupid shit sometimes? Absolutely. But who doesn’t? At least he isn’t lying about what he is while secretly living it in the shadows.
The reason men respect him has nothing to do with party lines. It’s the refusal to bow. The refusal to grovel for permission to exist as a man.
He stands where most would fold, takes the hits, keeps walking.
That’s the energy we respond to. Not politics, but principle.
Jordan Peterson talks about it from another angle, the intellectual form of the same truth. Responsibility as the path to meaning. “Stand up straight with your shoulders back,” he says. Simple, ancient wisdom: carry weight.
And men listened, because the world told them for decades that their weight was toxic. Peterson reminded them it was sacred.
Then there’s Tate. You can hate him, mock him, dissect him, but you can’t ignore him. He’s a mirror held up to a generation of men starved for directness. The world censored him, tried to erase him, and what happened? His name got louder. Because he touches something primal: the hunger for structure, danger, and freedom wrapped in order.
These men are lightning rods for a reason. They remind the world what it fears: conviction. The willingness to stand in the storm and not flinch.
Meanwhile, back home, men apologize for existing. They sit through HR seminars about “toxic masculinity” while their girlfriends secretly fantasize about the very traits those seminars condemn. That’s the split reality we live in. Denounce strength publicly, crave it privately.
So here’s the question: will your children thank you for this softness?
Will they thank you for your empathy, your compliance, your moral performance?
Or will they hate you for trading their inheritance for your comfort?
Your softness today becomes their suffering tomorrow. They won’t remember your virtue-signaling. They’ll remember whether you stood or bowed. Whether you built or complied. Whether you chose being liked over being right.
The feminine doesn’t want a man who yields to her empathy. She wants a man strong enough to carry it. That’s what real leadership is, absorbing chaos and returning order.
I used to think life was about enjoyment; collecting experiences, chasing novelty, tasting freedom.
But ungoverned pleasure is poison. It corrodes discipline, and without discipline, the masculine decays. At first it feels like liberation; later you realise it’s decay dressed as freedom.
Real life isn’t about indulgence. It’s about sacrifice. For legacy. For lineage. For the blood that got you here, and the blood that’ll carry your name after you’re gone.
Our culture worships ease. Pathologizes pain. Mocks structure. Then wonders why no one feels safe.
Men have traded purpose for pleasure. Mission for comfort. Structure for sedation. And when men soften, civilisations fracture. The more pleasure you chase, the weaker you become; the weaker you become, the easier you are to control.
I’m not trying to create division, or sow hatred. This is just the undeniable truth, based off the physics of biology and nature.
Strength preserves life. Weakness invites decay. And we as a civilisation need to bring back sacrifice. honour. Strength.
The greatest shame of our generation isn’t what we’ve done, it’s what we’ve refused to fight for. Our ancestors died forging nations. We’re afraid to post the truth online.
So here’s what I know, not from theory but from living it:
A man who cannot protect will not be desired.
A man who cannot lead will not be followed.
A man who cannot build will not be remembered.
You cannot lead what you haven’t mastered.
Structure is safety. Softness without principle is collapse.
The feminine tests. The masculine proves.
These aren’t opinions. They’re laws.
This chapter is the diagnosis.
The next begins the reconstruction.
Now we break the boy, and we build the man.

Chapter 2: Break the Boy, Build the Man
There's no soft passage into masculinity. You don't become a man because you quoted Marcus Aurelius or posted about discipline under a gym selfie. You get dragged into it. Usually by life kicking you in the teeth while everyone watches.
Real masculine power doesn't grow in comfort. It's built in humiliation, exhaustion, and failure. You have to get broken properly before you stand tall. The boy dies when you realise no one's coming to save you, and that you've probably been the problem all along.
I learned that the hard way.
Eighteen years old, three lads in a tiny office in Reading; me, Craig, and Monty, pretending we were businessmen. We called it Dedipower. Sounded like a billion-dollar enterprise. In reality, it was a glorified room above a tyre shop.
Not a metaphor. An actual tyre shop.
We told clients the datacentre was in a "secure, undisclosed location" for security reasons. The truth? We just didn't want them to see it. Half-dead servers on metal racks, wires everywhere, the constant smell of burnt rubber wafting up from below. I'd be on the phone pitching enterprise-grade hosting while the mechanic downstairs was revving a Vauxhall Astra with no exhaust.
It was ridiculous. And it worked.
We blew the building's electricity limit within weeks. So instead of doing something sensible, we decided to steal power from next door. Dug up the car park ourselves with a pneumatic drill. In flip-flops. Sparks flying, concrete chips flying into our eyes, neighbours watching in disbelief. I'm shouting, "Mate, it's fine, I saw a video on YouTube!" while Craig's trying to keep me from electrocuting myself. Oh wait, YouTube didn’t even exist back then…
We ran our own armoured cable through the trench, dragged it up the wall, paid a local electrician named Wayne to connect it. I asked his surname for the paperwork. "King," he says. Wayne King. I nearly pissed myself. Craig just muttered, "We're going to prison."
But it worked. The servers came alive. The lights stopped flickering. Three boys above a tyre shop were now "data infrastructure specialists."
Those early days were pure chaos, held together by caffeine and delusion. We'd have actual corporate clients visiting for site tours. Proper businesses wanting to see where their data lived. We'd meet them in the car park, guide them past the tyre shop—"Yes, that's just a neighbouring business"—and up these dodgy stairs that creaked like they were about to collapse. One guy in a full suit looked around our "datacentre," saw the exposed wiring and the fire extinguisher we'd bought from Argos, and just said, "This is very... boutique." We signed him anyway.
Monty was our voice of reason, which tells you how bad things were. He'd look at something I was about to do and just say, "Don't." Usually I'd do it anyway. Like the time I convinced a major e-commerce client we had "redundant power systems across multiple facilities." We had one pokey room above a tyre shop. With stolen electricity. I was nineteen.
Monty left soon after for university. Smart bastard. That left me and Craig—the oddest duo you could imagine. He was the brains, the engineer. The yin and the yang. He could take apart anything and rebuild it blindfolded. In turn, I was the energy, the salesman, the frontman. He built it, I sold it. Perfect chaos. Or moreover, I sold it, then told him to figure out how to build it after.
And for a while, it was magic. Clients came in, invoices got paid, we were building an actual company. Staff. Logo. Accountant. I even bought a suit. Felt like a king. Used to take girls back from the local nightclub to my office and bang them on the desk.
That's the trap. Early success hides rot. You start believing your own story.
Craig was clocking sixteen-hour days, keeping the tech running, doing the work of three people. I was out pitching, networking, shaking hands, convincing clients we were basically NASA. The problem was, Craig's calm competence made me reckless. I thought I could outtalk reality.
I had presence, drive, instinct. What I lacked was structure. When you're young and talented, the world rewards you fast enough to convince you you're already a man. But raw talent without discipline is a bomb with a delayed fuse.
We'd been running on that dodgy power setup for months, pretending it was stable. One night, everything went down. The entire estate. Shops, offices, houses—the whole neighbourhood plunged into darkness. Our servers died instantly. No lights, no aircon, no sound, just the deep silence of panic.
Despite our promises of backup redundant power systems, we quite obviously, had none.
I called Craig. No answer. Tried again. Nothing. Finally got a text: "In the Bahamas. No internet."
Perfect.
For three days, I didn't sleep. Clients were calling nonstop. I was sweating like Joe Biden in a playground, running between the server room and the fuse box, trying to look like I knew what the fuck I was doing. I hadn't eaten. My hands were black with oil and dust. Electricians coming and going, neighbours shouting about their lights, one bloke threatening to sue us for ruining his night shift.
At one point, I just sat on the floor surrounded by wires, staring at a fried circuit board, thinking, "So this is entrepreneurship."
Craig finally called on the third day. Calm as ever. "What happened?"
"We took out half of Reading."
He sighed. "Told you that cable was dodgy."
That moment changed me. Because I realised the truth: Craig wasn't just the tech guy—he was the spine. He carried the structure. I just danced on top of it.
But I didn't grow up just yet. Not straight away. I learned the lesson intellectually, but my ego was still in charge.
Dedipower exploded in size. New offices, staff, press coverage. Suddenly I was "the face of the company." Doing interviews about entrepreneurship and vision. Thought I was invincible. Craig was still in the trenches, quietly building, holding it all together.
Then came the DJing.
What started as a hobby turned into an obsession. I loved it; the music, the adrenaline, the crowd. I was good at it too. Suddenly I wasn't just "the business guy." I was the DJ, the brand, the personality. And I convinced myself it was all connected. That music and business were two sides of the same creative coin. Bollocks. I was just chasing validation again, but in a different costume with the same addiction.
I believed I could split myself: dominate the boardroom by day, command the dancefloor by night. I told myself I could juggle it all. DJ sets, women, drinking, the narcotic of attention. But life doesn't bow to boys chasing chaos. It breaks them.
Craig saw it happening. He'd be in the office at 8 a.m. and I'd stumble in at noon with sunglasses on, reeking of vodka Red Bull, saying, "Big night of networking, mate." He'd just nod, type something, say, "We've got three servers down."
We had one argument that never really ended. He told me, "You've stopped caring about this." I told him, "You don't understand growth." What utter bullshit.
I was chasing lights, he was chasing uptime. You can guess which one builds empires.
The thing about Craig was, he never shouted. Never made it dramatic. He'd just look at me with this expression—not disappointed, not angry, just tired. That's worse somehow. When someone stops fighting you because they've already written you off, that cuts deeper than any argument.
Craig saw me slipping, distracted, addicted to being seen. He didn't shame me, but he didn't lie either. He challenged me. Confronted me. And I couldn't take it. I didn't yet have the spine to receive the truth like a man, because I hadn't become one.
Eventually, it broke. I walked away from the day-to-day. Still owned my shares, still showed up for the big stuff, but mentally I was gone, off chasing my DJ dream. The split hurt. I loved Craig, but I needed chaos. Stability bored me.
I lost the mirror. The friend who showed me what I was too proud to admit: that I hadn't earned the role I was performing. That I was surfing on charm and momentum, not anchored in discipline or integrity. And I hated him for it, because he was right. When someone threatens your illusion, the ego defends itself with disdain.
He kept building. Dedipower kept growing. When we finally sold, it went for millions. Real money. Enough to make my parents proud and my ego worse. On paper, success. In reality, I was empty.
I had freedom now. Money, time, recognition, and no idea what to do with it. That's the curse of getting rich too early. You think you've reached the summit, but really, you've just run out of distractions.
Shanghai was next. The city of speed. Perfect for someone who can't sit still. I joined M1NT Shanghai as Music Director. My DJ career took off properly there. I was living every boy's fantasy: women, money, fame. The skyline lit up for me.
I was driving around a Rolls Royce Ghost, rocking up to DJ sets with 1000s of people trying to get in downstairs, slamming just as many tequilas as I was women.
And yet, deep down, I knew I was still that kid from Reading blagging it above a tyre shop. Just with better lighting and higher stakes.
Shanghai has this way of feeding your ego while draining your soul. The city rewards performance like divinity. You're never not on. Every dinner is a deal. Every drink is a connection. Every conversation is positioning. I was running deals by day, DJing by night, sleeping never. My phone never stopped. Surrounded by people, constantly alone.
I wasn't living with clarity. I was drifting on charisma. I had women, but no devotion. Wealth, but no foundation. Influence, but no internal order. And the worst part? On the surface, it all looked like success.
That's the most dangerous shape of stagnation: the seduction of potential. When you're talented enough to win without effort, you forget that effort is the furnace that forges the man.
One night, I stood on the balcony at M1NT, looking down at a crowd losing their minds to my track. Champagne raining, girls screaming, my name flashing across LED screens. Teenage me would've thought this was heaven.
I felt absolutely nothing. Just numb.
Don’t get me wrong, I fucking loved my decade in Shanghai. Epic memories, amazing people. I can travel to any city in the world now and have a connection or a friend there to have dinner with. But all those experiences, the pursuit of pleasure, the massaging of my ego, were just fleeting. They didn’t add to my legacy.
That's the moment the boy dies—when the applause stops meaning anything.
Bali. December 31st, 2020. I’d travelled there for holiday and got stuck there when covid was announced. That evening I was reflecting on the partying from the previous night.
It was NYE but there was no party. No audience. No stage. Just a villa, a hangover, a still pool under grey light. The afterglow of excess dimmed to nothing. The girls were asleep. The bottles were empty. The show was over. I stood alone by the water and felt it—not pain, but disconnection. Not from others, but from myself.
I didn't scream. I didn't seek revenge on the world. I didn't scribble down a New Year's resolution.
I just stopped drinking.
No announcement. No public reckoning. No weepy Instagram posts. I simply closed the door on chaos and began the silent, unglamorous labour of reconstruction. Not the man the world applauded, but the one I'd neglected to become.
That was the vow. Not to impress. Not to prove. But to realign every facet of my life around a structure so clean, so firm, it could carry not only me, but the tribe I knew was coming.
Because I wasn't just living for myself anymore. I was preparing to father an army. To lead multiple women. To guide children. And that kind of life doesn't bend to chaos. It requires law.
From that moment, everything began to shift. My mornings came back. My body reawakened. My mind reformed like steel under discipline. Cold showers. Real food. Started reading—not motivational crap, just history, psychology, things with depth. Slowly, the fog lifted.
When you start keeping promises to yourself, you stop needing applause from others. That's when confidence shifts from the fleeting nature of performance to the undeniable, weighty presence of an established truth.
I thought back often to Craig during that time. The quiet discipline. The steadiness. I used to envy his calm. Now I understood it. He wasn't calm because he lacked ambition, he was calm because he was grounded. I mean he wasn’t perfect either. In fairness he was a bit of a social retard. But I look back now in fond memories of him and owe him a lot for all the things I have today.
My father didn't know how to lead me. Not because he didn't love me, he did, endlessly. When I was a young adult his best friend told me that he used to worry himself to sleep about how the divorce with my mother would affect me. Whenever I needed him, he was there. But he didn't have the map. His own father died young. He was left to navigate manhood alone. Sent to boarding school. Bullied. Hardened, not by vision, but by absence. He did his best. He showed up. He supported. But he couldn't initiate. Couldn't demand my greatness. Couldn't challenge me with the beautiful, necessary violence a boy needs when he's lingering on the edge of softness.
My mother, though? She taught me drive. Working-class Liverpool girl who became CEO of a major drinks company. Climbed every wall in her way, refused to apologise for her ambition. I worshipped her for it. Still do. But I watched the cost too. The loneliness. The armour she wore so long she forgot how to take it off.
She's alone now. Still fierce. Still surgically intelligent. But alone. She divorced my father in her forties. They were elements that never learned to synchronise—fire and seawater. Where she surged, he steadied. Where she demanded, he demurred.
And I carry a question I never had language for as a boy: Did she ever get to rest in her feminine side? Did she ever feel safe enough to soften, to surrender, to be held by a man who didn't require her to lead?
I don't know if she did. She was strong, undeniably. Unbreakable. But I'm not sure she was ever allowed to simply be a woman. Not a CEO. Not a warrior. Just a woman, wrapped in masculine order so steady, so present, that she could finally exhale.
That question lives in me now. It clarifies me with purpose. I don't want to recreate that story. I want to rewrite it. I don't just want to be present, like my father was. I want to lead. I want to build a structure so clear, so dependable, that the women in my life never have to perform strength.
Years later, Craig and I met for a beer. First time in ages we'd actually talked properly. He said, "You used to sell the dream, mate. I just made sure the servers stayed online."
He was right. That's most men in their twenties—selling dreams before they've built foundations.
Dedipower taught me everything. How to fail. How to improvise. How to bleed through chaos and come out laughing. We were idiots, but we built something real. We went from flip-flops and drills to millions and exit papers. And somewhere in that madness, the boy version of me died.
Breaking the boy isn't a single moment. It's a slow series of humiliations that finally strip you of your own bullshit. The late nights, the fights, the panic attacks, the 3 a.m. realisations that you've become everything you used to mock.
Every man has his "Craig moment"—that confrontation with reality where the universe quietly says, enough. You either break or you build.
You can fake charisma. You can fake confidence. But you can't fake competence. The world spots the difference instantly.
That's masculinity. Not posturing, not dominance, just competence. Quiet consistency. The kind that doesn't need validation because it's too busy building something that lasts.
In turn, you cannot lead what you haven't mastered. You cannot demand devotion while your appetites still drag you like a leash. Women don't follow your words. They follow your energy. They don't submit to your desire, they submit to your discipline.
Breaking the boy costs everything. Your illusions. Your shortcuts. Your excuses. But what's left, the stillness, the focus, the backbone, is worth more than anything you've lost.
The boy wants recognition. The man wants mastery.
The boy sells the dream. The man builds the system.
And that shift hurts like hell. But once it happens, there's no going back.

Chapter 3: Polarity Is Nature
I met her in Bali. Striking, radiant. Every movement, every gesture, meticulously calibrated to command attention; not for beauty's sake, but for the confirmation of power.
Her Instagram was a carefully curated shrine to sovereignty: long captions extolling self-love, "divine femininity," and spiritual independence. Posts about men being too weak to handle her, declarations that she would never settle, that she was enough. She had constructed an entire persona around being untouchable, a goddess in her own mythology. And to most men, she probably was.
But when we met, I didn’t chase. I didn’t flatter. I didn’t search for common ground. I simply watched, studied how she moved, how she filled every silence before it could reveal something real. I refused to play her game. And precisely because of that, she found herself drawn into mine.
The next day, she came to my villa. She didn't say much. She just walked in, her skirt was short, and her posture was half-defiant and half-uncertain, the kind of nervous tension that lingers when the mind tries to override the body's deeper intuition. She stood there, suspended, as if unsure why she'd come, while some unspoken part of her already knew. I didn't interrogate her motives. I didn't declare my desires. I didn't need to.
I stepped toward her, close enough for her breath to catch. My hand found her neck, slow, deliberate—not with aggression, but with a quiet, sovereign certainty. In that moment, her entire body transformed. Her exhale deepened. Shoulders dropped. Legs softened. It was as if some ancient code in her nervous system had just been activated, receiving the permission it didn't know it craved.
She looked up at me with a startled softness, a wild mix of awe and surrender, as though I’d unlocked something terrifyingly intense, and whispered, “How did you know that was my thing?”
I met her gaze, unflinching. “It’s not just your thing. It’s every woman’s thing. Especially women like you.”
She said nothing. She didn’t have to. Her body was already in full confession. The nervous system never lies. And in that instant, her entire performance collapsed.
We kept seeing each other after that night. With every encounter, I watched her mask dissolve. The Instagram persona faded. Her voice softened. Her movements slowed. The storm inside her grew quiet. Not because I told her to calm down, but because, for the first time, she didn’t have to lead. She could exhale. She could simply be.
One morning, as she was about to leave, I asked her what that first moment together felt like.
She paused, searching for precision, then looked at me with a clarity that cut through the morning air.
“I absolutely loved it. I needed to be commanded. That’s what I want. That’s what I crave.”
In that sentence, everything was confirmed.
What she longed for was not abuse, not domination, not even sex. She wanted a man who could see beyond performance, who was so deeply anchored in himself that she could finally collapse into her own nature without fear.
The truth is, those who shout the loudest about independence are often the ones who yearn most to be led, not just anyone, but by a man strong enough to hold them fully. A man who does not flinch. Who does not barter for approval, who refuses to dilute himself for comfort.
What she felt that morning was not shame. It was not submission in the way society warns women to fear. It was relief, the relief of finally being allowed to rest, to surrender, to be claimed by someone who knows what to do with her chaos.
She wants to feel the spine of a man who can handle everything she's been carrying, without being lost in the process. And her body will always know before her mind does.
The moment you are, the fight leaves her. The armor drops. And yes, often, she will kneel. Not in defeat, but in relief. Because finally, she doesn't have to carry the world anymore.
This is polarity.
Modern men live in delusion. They believe if they say the right words, check the correct boxes, and pledge allegiance to the latest ideology, she’ll desire them more. They confuse agreement with attraction. But attraction isn’t born in ideas, it lives in the realm of instinct.
Polarity, real, raw, sexual polarity, isn’t an intellectual exercise. It is biological, psychological, and spiritual. It doesn’t bend to your beliefs or to the fashion of the times.
You can recite feminist talking points, celebrate her independence, applaud her ambition, and call her “strong”, but if she’s more grounded than you, more structured, more certain in herself than you are in yourself, she will never crave you. Her body does not hunger for your approval. It aches for your order.
Polarity is the dance of penetration and reception. Forward and open. Chaos and order. Emotion and clarity. The feminine doesn’t open to more emotion, she opens to the man who can contain it.
Look to nature for the blueprint. The egg does not swim; the sperm does. The mountain does not chase the storm, it absorbs it. When masculine presence holds feminine chaos without flinching, biology takes over. It triggers a response hard-coded into the nervous system.
This is why a woman can shout empowerment in public and melt at a whisper in private. Why the loudest feminists often crave the strongest men. Because, regardless of what her mind says, her body remembers.
She was never meant to be everything. She was meant to be radiant, soft, wild, but only when the structure is strong enough to hold her. And you? You were never meant to be agreeable. You were meant to be immovable.
Stop arguing with her. Stop trying to earn respect with words. Stand your ground. Speak your law. Lead without apology. Polarity is not something you create; it’s something you enforce.
And when you do, she doesn't just follow. She blooms.
There’s a reason she melted when I touched her neck. A reason her body responded before her mouth could protest. It wasn’t social conditioning. It wasn’t patriarchal programming. It was nature. Hard-coded, universal, and timeless.
She doesn’t want to be merely equal, she wants to be reorganised. Not by a tyrant. Not by a supplicant masquerading as “safe.” But by a man whose presence holds so much order that her very biology realigns itself just to feel it again.
You don't surface this truth by convincing her. You don't lecture her out of her armor. You stop playing the supplicant's game. You become the force that does not flinch. The man whose very presence disarms her mask. And when her chaos meets your spine, her soul exhales, and her body kneels.
Polarity is alive in the room. Not in theory. Not in dialogue. In the silent moments when her nervous system recognizes something real. Something ancient. When her performance drops, and instinct takes the wheel.
There are women so hot, so untouchable, they've learned to bend men without trying. Men who become mute in their presence—nodding too much, saying the right things, compliments her outfit, and laughing moment too long.
That’s not me.
When I speak to women like this, I don't flinch. I don't temper my tone. I don't contort myself to impress. I speak plainly, unapologetically. I say exactly what I think, especially the things they aren't supposed to hear. And it shakes them.
The shock doesn’t register on their faces; it lands somewhere deeper, a glitch in the simulation. They pause, recalibrating, wondering why the usual scripts aren’t working, why their power isn’t landing, why, for the first time, they’re listening instead of performing.
It's simple: I don't play their game. I built my own.
But I wasn't always this man. The first time I ever fell in love, I did everything “right.”
Her name was Stephanie. I was sixteen, maybe seventeen. Young. Naive. I met her through a friend, a kind of blind date setup. No smartphones back then, just old-school intentions. I remember standing at the train station, calling her from a payphone. No answer. I called again. Still nothing. Yet I went anyway.
Eventually, she picked up. I walked an hour from the station just to see her. And when I did, we clicked instantly. That's the thing about early love: you don't overthink, you just feel. We spent hours on the phone every day. I had never experienced anything like it. I was loyal, completely. There were other girls who made moves; I turned them down. I wasn't cheating. I was all in. Because when you're young and you feel that kind of connection, you believe it's forever. You think love is enough.
But it wasn’t.
Not long after, she met someone else, a local bouncer. Twenty-eight. Kickboxer. Tattoos. Menace in his presence, years older than either of us. But he had something I didn’t: real-world, physical, violent power. The kind of force most nice boys never learn to carry.
She fell for it. She cheated. I found out.
My first heartbreak, the kind that lingers in your gut and rewrites your sense of self. It got worse. I started mouthing off, talking shit about him around town. Word traveled. One night, outside a kebab shop, he cornered me. Smashed my jaw with a right elbow. I got properly beaten. Humiliated. I tried to press charges, got threatened, had to drop the case.
Ostracized from clubs, shut out from nightlife. My world shrank. I had to adapt. So, I did. I made new friends. Toughened up. It became a crucible. And in that fire, the first sparks of who I am now began to burn.
Ironically, a few years later, the guy killed himself. People even joked that it was because of me. I didn't laugh. I just noted the symmetry. Life always finds its own way to close the loop. Years after that, Stephanie reached out again. Of course, she did.
By then, I had built something: success, presence, and stature. She fell for me all over again, couldn't help herself. She tried to revive what we once had, but it was gone. Not because I hated her; I didn't. I cared for her and wished her well. But the boy she betrayed no longer existed. And I wasn’t about to return to the scene of my own undoing just to play the same part twice. I turned her down. Kindly, but without hesitation.
She found her happy ending—married, had kids. A good man, I think. But that chapter stayed with me, not as trauma, but as a lesson.
She might say she wants sweet, loyal, safe. But when confronted with danger, dominance, and presence, most will gravitate toward the flame. And when you lose that flame, she'll start looking for a man who has it.
Polarity doesn’t care about promises. It only answers to power.
If Stephanie was the lesson, Amy was the ghost.
I met her when I was twenty-two, maybe twenty-three. Christmas Day, of all days. Through family. One of those coincidences that feels scripted. She walked in, and I just knew. Proper jaw-drop moment. Beautiful, but not just that—she could handle me. Quick tongue, sharp eyes, didn’t flinch. She could throw fire back.
We were both wild then—chaotic, passionate, untamed. It wasn’t built to last, but fuck, it felt real. I even wrote a song about her—I Love Ya. A rap, of all things. Probably terrible, but it meant something.
We drifted apart. Years later, I found out she’d had a daughter with some gangster bloke. A proper roadman. Scary reputation. I know how that sounds. But it was what it was.
When we reconnected years later, I thought, maybe this is it. Maybe it circles back. But it didn’t. Timing’s a bitch.
Still, when my mum asked me recently, “Who’s the one girl you ever really loved?” I didn’t even think. I said, “Amy.” She smiled and said she knew I’d say that.
Mad, isn’t it? All the success, the travel, the women, and the one that sticks is the one that never worked.
She’s older now. So’s her daughter. Beautiful kid. Every now and then, Amy and I talk. Nothing romantic. Just that quiet connection that never fully dies. She was the only one who could meet me in the middle, fire for fire.
If Stephanie taught me what breaks a man, Amy showed me what could’ve built one.
Some women are waiting for a man strong enough to transform them into something they didn’t know they could be. I didn’t understand that in my twenties. Back then, I believed submission was something you earned through charm, control, or bedroom skill. I assumed it was granted to the man who made a woman feel warm, loved, who proved himself trustworthy, who positioned himself as the better choice in a sea of unreliable suitors. I thought it was a prize for performance, the reward for being the “good guy.”
But it’s not that at all.
Submission isn’t granted to the man who seeks it. It’s offered, unspoken, unforced, to the man who no longer needs it. It’s a reflex, not a negotiation. It emerges not from a woman’s rational mind, but from something far deeper: the subconscious, biological part of her that responds to presence, certainty, and unshakeable order.
In my thirties, something shifted. My presence matured. I stopped performing, stopped chasing approval. I began building with discipline, living by law, moving through life with a clarity that didn't require validation. I was rooted in mission, not mood. And something remarkable happened. Without trying to change anyone, the women around me began to change themselves.
Women who, on the surface, seemed anything but submissive—high-achievers, self-proclaimed feminists, women who had never followed a man in their lives—started softening. Not because I demanded it. Not because I coaxed it out of them. Simply because I embodied something their bodies trusted.
They began listening more intently, moving more slowly, syncing their rhythm to mine without even realising they were doing it. Their nervous systems settled. Their eyes lingered. Their touch deepened. They wanted to give, not as an obligation, but as an offering. They wanted to nurture, to serve, to bring peace to a man who required nothing but inspired everything.
And for some, it didn't stop there.
Some brought me other women, not from desperation or deficiency, but from desire. It turned them on to witness my power echo through another body. They weren’t jealous. They were ignited. It was amplification, not competition. Their pleasure came from watching another woman surrender as they had, knowing that what they felt wasn’t unique to them. It was a response to structure, to certainty, to the energy I held like gravity.
The sex, yes, was wild. But what mattered wasn't the physicality. It was the surrender. The psychological decentering of the ego. The dissolution of a persona that had spent years pretending not to need a man. It was the moment she realised she didn't have to perform strength anymore.
And once she went there, once she truly dropped all the way, there was no going back. Something rewired. The men she once found acceptable—the nice guys, the well-meaning partners offering "equality" and emotional openness—no longer moved her. They felt light. Ungrounded. Not malicious, just weightless. Like something she had to manage, not something she could trust.
Because something had been awakened. Something evolutionary. A part of her that didn’t want to negotiate leadership, it wanted to feel it. To be taken by a man whose frame doesn’t tremble, whose decisions don’t waiver, whose presence could father her children.
Once she finds that, it marks her. It imprints on her. She may not be able to articulate why, but she knows. Her body knows. There's no need to convince her, to keep seducing her with tactics or charm. She's already yours. She feels the truth of her nature reflected in you.
That’s what submission really is—not a kink, not a fetish, not about dominance games or who pays for dinner. It’s the deepest biological expression of feminine polarity: the quiet recognition that the right man doesn’t have to ask her to kneel. He simply becomes the man in whose presence she finally remembers who she is when she does.
Look around this modern world. Look at the dryness, the confusion, the flatness in relationships that once sparked with fire. The problem isn’t too much polarity, it’s not enough. The roles have been blurred, the archetypes are erased. Men stopped leading. Women were forced to harden. And now everyone is exhausted.
Polarity is not the threat. It is the source code.
________________
Chapter 4: Reverse Darwinism
Before we built skyscrapers and dating apps, status was simple. It wasn’t money, followers, or blue ticks. It was survival. You earned your place by how well you could hunt, build, protect, and lead. And the men who did that best? They got the women. Not through manipulation, but through competence.
Every old tribe had the same setup. The top men fathered most of the children. Not some wild theory, actual genetic data backs it. Over time, around 80% of women had kids. Less than half the men did. That’s nature making executive decisions. Polygamy wasn’t scandalous; it was strategy.
The best males, whether through strength, wit, or presence, rose to the top. Women competed for them. The weak ones died off quietly, or stayed single and useful in other ways. From nature’s perspective, it was efficient. Stronger bloodlines. Better protection. The tribe survived.
It wasn’t fair. It was functional. Nature doesn’t give a damn about equality; it optimizes for continuity.
And the logic made sense. A few capable men leading, feeding, and protecting many women and children meant more people survived. Fewer warriors needed, more nurturers available. The tribe grew. Everyone benefited; except the men who couldn’t compete.
That system worked flawlessly for tens of thousands of years. It appeared across continents, religions, and races without a single central plan. It just worked. Because it was instinctual. Because it was real.
Then we invented morality.
Modern people love to apply moral outrage backwards, as if fairness was ever part of the original deal. They say, “Every man deserves love.” No, he doesn’t. He has to earn it. The problem is, we built a world that pretends nature can be negotiated with.
We decided comfort was more important than truth.
The Great Softening
As tribes became cities, cities became empires, and empires became bureaucracies, the wild logic of nature stopped working for the system. Polygyny, the most natural model, was suddenly dangerous. Too many single men with nothing to lose meant riots, rebellion, and blood on marble floors.
So the rulers found a clever fix. Not “make the weak stronger,” but “contain the strong.”
One woman per man. Not because it was moral, but because it was manageable.
It kept the peace.
Rome was the first to formalize it. Augustus literally fined bachelors for staying single and rewarded marriage. Not to celebrate love, but to stabilize the empire. He didn’t care about romance. He cared about order. The elite still had mistresses and harems, of course. The rules were for the masses. Always are.
As religion took over, control got rebranded as holiness.
The Church absorbed Rome’s family laws and painted them with divine varnish. Suddenly, monogamy wasn’t politics—it was “God’s will.” Lust became sin. Multiplicity became evil. Masculine abundance became a threat to virtue.
Brilliant move, really. If you want to run an empire, tell every man:
“You don’t need more. Be content.”
“You’re equal to stronger men.”
“Your instincts are dangerous.”
“Suppress them for the greater good.”
And it worked like a dream.
Monogamy pacified entire populations. It gave weaker men access they couldn’t have earned. It gave women stability in exchange for exclusivity. It gave the state control over family life. And it told everyone that compromise was holiness.
It didn’t just shape culture—it shaped consciousness.
Under the surface, it wasn’t morality. It was management.
The strong were softened. The state was stabilized. Nature’s meritocracy was swapped for civilisation’s middle ground.
That’s what I call The Great Softening.
We replaced instinct with ideology. Selection with sympathy.
From Morality to Machinery
Over time, the idea hardened into structure.
What began as social convenience turned into paperwork. Marriage became a legal event. Property combined, taxes merged, heirs registered. The family wasn’t just a home anymore—it was a data point.
The Church didn’t just bless unions; it recorded them. Controlled them. Defined them. Monogamy wasn’t just suggested—it was mandated.
And the purpose wasn’t love. It was logistics.
For a government, “one man, one woman, one heir” is tidy. Fewer inheritance disputes, simpler tax collection, less chaos. Monogamy kept society legible.
Polygynous families were messy—multiple wives, competing claims, confused property lines. You can’t build a neat empire when everyone’s raising kids with different surnames and different mothers. So the system flattened the complexity.
It made sense for spreadsheets. It made no sense for biology.
Over generations, the legal model infected morality. Exclusivity became virtue. Sharing became shameful. A man with multiple women was now “immoral.” A woman who accepted such a man was “damaged.”
These weren’t natural conclusions. They were social software updates.
And they worked. By the time modernity arrived, nobody questioned it. Monogamy wasn’t just the rule, it was the air everyone breathed. The machine had done its work.
Organisms are Algorithms
There is a theory that organisms are algorithms. Not metaphorically,  literally. Every living thing, from bacteria to billionaires, is just a decision-making engine trying to survive and reproduce. That’s it. The rest is decoration.
Every time you think you’re making a “choice,” you’re basically running internal code. Billions of micro-decisions firing through neurons, hormones, bacteria in your gut, all negotiating over one question: What keeps us alive long enough to fuck and pass this code on?
It’s not romantic, but it’s true. Your stomach bacteria probably influence your moods more than your childhood trauma ever did. Serotonin? Ninety percent of it’s made in your gut. Your “intuition” is literally the whisper of microorganisms discussing supply chains.
The more you zoom out, the funnier it gets. Free will looks less like a divine gift and more like an illusion created to keep the software running smoothly. If your body suddenly told you, “Hey, we’re just manipulating you into chasing dopamine so we can replicate DNA,” you’d probably stop playing the game. So nature built in a trick: the feeling of choice.
When you “decide” to message her at midnight, that’s not free will. That’s a chemical democracy voting 51–49 in favour of potential reproduction. You just happen to be the spokesperson.
But here’s the part that actually matters, awareness changes the algorithm. You can’t stop being biological, but you can start being intentional. You can train the machine. Change inputs, rewrite responses. Discipline = hacking biology.
Every rep in the gym, every cold shower, every time you choose silence over reaction, that’s you reprogramming the algorithm. You’re teaching your nervous system that discomfort isn’t death. You’re proving to your internal council that stability equals survival.
And women feel that. Always. Because their own algorithms are scanning for one thing: can this man’s code hold mine? She’s not consciously thinking that, of course. She’s just running her own ancient script: test for safety, test for consistency, test for direction.
That’s all polarity really is. Not poetry. Not tantra. Just two complex biological systems trying to sync their code without crashing.
Once you understand that, the whole idea of “games” disappears. You stop overanalyzing texts or waiting for validation. You realise she’s not testing your ego, she’s testing your stability, she’s seeing if your algorithm holds under load.
So stop pretending to be spiritual when you’re just glitching. Learn your code. Rewrite it.
Rewarding the Weak
Here’s where it gets funny.
In the natural order, the strongest men reproduce more. It’s obvious. They’re fitter, sharper, more capable. The tribe benefits.
In the modern order, that logic is reversed.
Our system now subsidizes mediocrity. It redistributes affection like welfare. Caps the top, cushions the bottom. The same way governments manage money, society now manages desire.
Every man is told he “deserves” love. Every woman is told to value “stability” over magnetism. Men who could lead entire families are told to self-limit. Men who can’t lead themselves are told they’re “enough.”
It’s the moral equivalent of a participation trophy.
Evolution used to reward excellence. Now we protect fragility.
The message is everywhere:
* “All men are equally worthy.”
* “A good man doesn’t lead, he listens.”
* “Masculine desire is toxic.”
Translation: sit down, stay soft, be manageable.
The result is a world full of kind, confused men and unfulfilled women pretending everything’s fine.
Meanwhile, the most capable men, the ones nature would’ve chosen to multiply, are told to suppress it all. One woman only, no matter how much value he can provide, how many lives he could improve.
That’s not morality. That’s population control.
The outcome is predictable: collapsing birth rates, broken homes, and endless therapy sessions about “connection.”
Reverse Darwinism. That’s what we’re living through.
The weakest lead families they can’t protect. The strongest are shamed for wanting more. Women are told to follow ideology instead of instinct. Everyone’s miserable, but at least it’s “equal.”
To be fair, the system had its moment. The Christian monogamous model built order when the world was chaos. It created discipline, education, inheritance, community. It worked for the old world—scarce resources, dangerous conditions.
But in the modern era of abundance, that same structure has become a cage. It still demands restraint, but gives no purpose for it. It preaches duty without destiny.
The result is sterile peace. No fire, no fight, no future.
Women Know the Truth
Women might parrot equality, but their instincts never changed.
In any environment where they’re free to choose, they cluster around the same men—the top 10 to 15 percent. Dating apps make it painfully clear. Most men get nothing. A handful get everything. It’s not misogyny, it’s math.
Hypergamy is just biology doing its job. It’s the evolutionary software saying: “Pick the man who could have many, and be the one he chooses.”
It’s why women are drawn to presence, leadership, and danger even when it ruins their lives. Because that’s the energy that kept their ancestors alive.
Modern culture tells them to chase “nice.” Biology tells them to chase “capable.” Guess which one wins when they’re ovulating?
They’ll tell you they want an emotionally available man who cries and journals. Then they go home with the one who leads.
I’ve met hundreds of women in their thirties; brilliant, beautiful, lonely as hell. Not because their standards are wrong, but because their options are extinct. The men they want to follow either already lead families or have no reason to commit to one woman who won’t follow anyway.
They don’t want equality. They want to rest in the presence of a man who doesn’t need them—but chooses them.
That’s the secret: they don’t need him to be exclusive. They need him to be selective.
The truth burns through the hashtags if you look close enough. Women are acting out biology under the banner of ideology. They’re sleeping with the strong while tweeting about fairness. They know what they’re doing. Their bodies haven’t forgotten.
When they finally admit that, everything softens. Because what they actually crave isn’t domination—it’s direction.
And when they find it, everything in them exhales.
Reclaiming the Natural Order
Monogamy made sense for empires. It doesn’t make sense for evolution.
It replaced merit with moral permission. It made the strong apologetic and the weak entitled. It told men to aim smaller and call it virtue.
For a while, it worked. It created stability out of chaos. But that stability has now rotted into stagnation. The promises—lifelong passion, equal partnership, permanent peace—have collapsed. Divorce is normal. Birth rates are falling. Desire is dying quietly behind closed doors.
What used to be sacred has become sterile.
The instinct never vanished—it just went underground. Men still want to lead, build, and multiply. Women still want to follow strength, not slogans.
Reclaiming nature isn’t regression. It’s realism.
It doesn’t mean going back to chaos, or men hoarding women like collectibles. It means rebuilding structure that reflects biology, not bureaucracy.
That starts with men capable of holding it.
Men who lead multiple women not out of ego, but out of discipline.
Men who can love deeply and still lead decisively.
Men who can carry weight without needing praise for it.
That’s the real challenge. It’s easy to be loyal when you’re suppressed. It’s harder when you have options and still choose order.
Leading multiple women isn’t indulgence—it’s responsibility squared. You can’t fake it. You can’t hide in it. You either lead with structure or drown in chaos.
Polygyny done badly is abuse. Polygyny done well is art.
It’s not about appetite. It’s about alignment.
Because when led correctly, it mirrors the oldest truth we have: nature rewards the competent. It always has.
The choice now isn’t between fairness and chaos. It’s between pretending we’re equal and building systems that work.
The modern world protects the weak. The natural order produces the strong.
And the future? It’ll belong to the ones honest enough to admit that—and brave enough to build accordingly.


Chapter 5: The Prime Directive
Morality is not a thing. It is a directional algorithm.
Stop looking for "good" and "bad." Those are children’s terms, useful for keeping toddlers from touching a hot stove or stealing a toy. In the real world—the world of physics, biology, capital, and empires—morality behaves like a system. It tries to map individual decisions onto long-term consequences.
The question isn’t “Is this moral?” The question is “Moral for what purpose?”
Everything cascades from that single point. There is no answer to morality without first identifying the Prime Directive. Morality is just the servant of the objective. If your objective is comfort, then discipline is immoral. If your objective is survival, then comfort is poison.
But here is where the fracture happens. The modern world is confused because it has forgotten that morality cannot be universal. It changes based on the scale of the entity you are trying to protect.
* Tribal Morality demands loyalty to the blood. You protect your brother even if he’s wrong.
* National Morality demands loyalty to the flag. You send your brother to die in a trench to save a stranger in the capital.
* Species Morality demands loyalty to the genome. You might sacrifice the nation to ensure humanity itself survives.
None of these align with Individual Morality.
If you look at the world through a time horizon of "Right Now," the moral choice is to end suffering immediately. It feels good. It feels "right." But if you zoom out to a time horizon of "1,000 Years," ending suffering now might destroy the resilience needed to survive the millennium.
Because of this disconnect, I have come to realise that the world is divided into two distinct species of thought.
First, you have the Utopians.
These are your modern leftists, the "empaths," the people who believe the goal of the human species is altruism. It sounds noble on a bumper sticker. It sounds lovely at a dinner party. But in practice, it is retarded. It is a mental defect because it ignores the fundamental architecture of reality.
These people are dangerous. They are dangerous because they believe human nature is a blank slate that can be rewritten if we just hug enough or ban enough words. When reality refuses to bend to their Utopia, they become tyrants. Their "kindness" is performative. They optimize for the immediate emotional hit—the dopamine rush of appearing "good."
The Utopian is the man who eats the seed corn.
Imagine a tribe facing a hard winter. They have one sack of corn left, reserved for planting in the spring. The tribe is hungry today. The children are crying. The Utopian hears the crying and breaks. His empathy overrides his logic. He grinds the seed corn into flour and bakes bread. Everyone eats. Everyone is happy tonight. He feels moral. But because he ate the seed, there is no harvest next year. The entire tribe goes extinct.
Then, you have the Realists.
These are the builders. The architects. The men who lean right not because of politics, but because of physics. We look at the raw materials of humanity—greed, tribalism, lust, ambition, hierarchy—and we do not cry about them. We build with them. We acknowledge the limitations of the hardware.
The Realist is the man standing guard over the seed corn with a spear. He hears the crying, too. But he refuses to grind the corn. He forces the tribe to endure the hunger tonight so that they do not starve to death next year. In the moment, he looks like a monster. He looks like a villain. But he is the only reason the tribe has a future.
That is the harder choice. It requires a stomach for reality that most modern men have lost. And that is why I believe the Realist—the cold, pragmatic builder—is the only truly moral actor left. We are the only ones willing to absorb the pain of today to secure the existence of tomorrow.
I am often told that I am cold.
I’ve sat in boardrooms, or at dinner with women I care about, and I’ve watched their eyes glaze over as I speak. They sense a detachment in me. They mistake it for a lack of empathy. They think I don't care about their feelings, their bad day, or their immediate discomfort.
They are wrong. I care too much to lie to them.
I simply operate on a different time horizon. Most people live their lives in minutes and hours. They optimize for the weekend. I think in decades. I think in centuries. When I look at a decision—whether it’s a business acquisition, a building design, or which woman I allow into my life—I am not asking, “Does this feel good right now?”
I am running a simulation into the future. I am asking, “Does this strengthen the bloodline? Does this add voltage to the system or drain it? Will this stand in fifty years?”
Because I operate on this species-level logic, I often stop explaining myself. I have the conversation in my own head, I run the calculus, I come to the conclusion, and I execute. To explain the advanced, multi-generational math to someone who is operating on the emotional logic of a teenager is a waste of breath. It’s like trying to explain the structural load of a concrete cantilever to someone who only cares about the paint color.
This disconnect is nowhere more violent than in the realm of relationships.
Look at the pushback against polygyny. Look at the visceral, programmed hatred society spits at a man who openly has multiple women. They call it toxic. They call it greedy. They call it "cheating" even when it’s honest.
But zoom out. Look at the Species Level. Look at the Prime Directive.
If the goal is the expansion and improvement of the species, the strengthening of your bloodline, then polygyny is not just acceptable; it is the most efficient algorithm ever written. It ensures that the highest-voltage men—the ones with the resources, the genetics, and the capacity to protect—pass on their code to the most amount of offspring. It ensures women have access to a King rather than sole ownership of a peasant.
Deep down, the biology knows this.
I have seen it in the women that are attracted to me. Their bodies know. Their ancient, biological hardware craves the competence and authority of a man who is too big for one woman to contain. They respond to it with a reverence that terrifies them.
But their software? Their software is corrupted. Their software is running "Modern Society v2.0," written by Disney, feminism, and weak men. So they fight it. They feel the attraction to the structure I provide, but their social conditioning screams that it is "wrong."
They are torn between their nature and their programming.
My job—my moral duty—is not to apologize for my nature. It is to override their programming. To provide a frame so strong, so undeniable, that their biological reality finally feels safe enough to surface.
We are living in a civilisation that has lost its Prime Directive.
Western morality was once the greatest operating system on earth. It combined Greek rationality, Roman order, and a metaphysical demand for sacrifice. It produced the modern world. But it was too successful. We won the game of survival, and in doing so, we rotted.
We removed the constraints. We made life too easy.
* Remove hardship, and discipline evaporates.
* Remove risk, and responsibility disappears.
* Remove consequences, and degeneracy becomes a valid lifestyle.
Now, we are maximizing "Individual Happiness." That is the current Prime Directive of the West. "Do what makes you feel good."
The result is mathematical ruin. Birth rates collapse because children are "inconvenient." Hedonism replaces duty. Men become soft because there is no war to fight and no family to lead. The system eats itself.
I refuse to participate in that suicide pact.
My Prime Directive aligns with Species Expansion.
Under this directive, the definitions change. "Good" is that which strengthens the tribe, the business, and the genetic legacy. "Evil" is that which makes you weak, sterile, or nihilistic.
Suddenly, building wealth is not greed; it is ammunition. Raising children is not a "lifestyle choice"; it is a command. Taking command of women is not "misogyny"; it is the restoration of natural order.
This is why I train so hard. This is why I fast for 40 hours a week. This is why I build concrete monoliths that will outlive me.
I am not interested in being happy. I am interested in being effective. I am not interested in being liked by a society that is actively dying. I am interested in building the Ark that survives the flood.
You can call that cold. You can call that arrogant. I call it the only morality that counts.
The Ghost in the Machine
Now, you will ask me: "Dominus, do you believe in God?"
It is a simple question with a complex answer.
I am not religious. I do not subscribe to the idea of an invisible man in the sky who watches you masturbate and checks a list of dietary restrictions. That is a fairy tale. It is laughable—not because I can disprove it, but because there are four thousand versions of it, and they all claim to be the sole truth. These are man’s lame, desperate attempts to draw a map of a territory he cannot comprehend.
However, I am not an atheist. Atheism is the arrogance of the blind man who asserts that because he cannot see the sun, it does not exist.
I understand the utility of religion. Yuval Noah Harari was right in Sapiens: Religion is the original "Shared Fiction." You cannot organize a million men with the promise of a banana. You can only organize them with the promise of a Heaven. Religion is the software that allows the human hardware to cooperate at scale. Without it, social cohesion dissolves into tribal warfare.
But my belief goes deeper than utility.
My species-level logic dictates that there must be something more than this.
Look at the edges of science. Look at the hard wall we hit when we try to explain reality.
* Consciousness: Science can explain the brain, but it cannot explain the mind. It cannot explain the "I" that is reading these words.
* Quantum Physics: We know that particles behave differently when they are observed. Reality itself seems to render only when consciousness interacts with it.
* The Infinite: How can the universe be infinite? But conversely, how can it have an end? What is outside the wall?
These questions are not glitches. They are features. They are evidence that the material world is not the base layer of reality.
I view "God" not as a personality, but as the Source Code.
There is an architecture to this universe. There is a mathematical precision to the way gravity holds a galaxy together and the way a woman submits to a man of higher voltage. These are not accidents. They are laws.
When I talk about the Prime Directive and Species Expansion, I am not just talking about biology. I am talking about something spiritual.
If we are just meat—accidental bacteria on a rock spinning in a void—then nothing matters. Nihilism is the only logical conclusion. If we are just meat, then "Directive A" (Hedonism) is the right choice. Eat, drink, and die.
But if we are something else—if we are the universe’s way of experiencing itself, if we are vessels for consciousness—then expanding the species is not just a biological imperative. It is a holy mission.
We are the custodians of the flame. To let that flame die out because we were too busy seeking "comfort" is the ultimate blasphemy.
I do not kneel in a church. I do not pray to a statue. But I bow to the Order of the Universe. I answer to the potential of what we could become.
A man who answers to nothing greater than himself is a dangerous fool. He becomes a tyrant or a nihilist. I answer to the future. I answer to the Infinite. And that is why I cannot rest.


Chapter 6: Certainty Fucks
Power fucks. Certainty fucks. Permission doesn’t.
That isn’t a slogan, it’s basic biology. A frequency running under language, humming in the nervous system. Once you see it, you can’t unsee it. Out in the wild, it’s never the lines or the dinner or the careful choreography that opens her. It’s the way you move. No flinch. No apology. No question mark.
Women don’t surrender to persuasion. They don’t unravel for a man waiting to be told he may. They open to certainty.
It’s the man who already knows he belongs inside her who draws the deepest surrender. The man who doesn’t fidget when her breath catches. The man who isn’t searching for signs. He is the sign. He moves like the answer is already "yes," not because he asked, but because he is the yes.
Modern ideology hates that. The feminine doesn’t. She wants to respond. She wants to relax into a gravity that doesn’t wobble when she tests it. She isn’t looking for your apology. She’s watching for your decision.
Attraction lives in the tension between containment and surrender. The spark is that knife-edge where the moment could collapse or ignite. What decides it isn’t charisma, not banter, but backbone.
The deeper you’re anchored in your own knowing, the deeper she can fall into hers. It is the energetic framework you carry into every space, every pause, every silence. Her body listens before her mind can form a thought. The test is simple: Can I trust him? Can I follow him? Can I let go without holding the frame myself?
If the answer is yes, she opens. Effortless. If your signal flickers, if you are negotiating with yourself, she tightens. She guards. Not because she is difficult, but because she must. If you will not lead, she has to. If she has to, she cannot surrender.
This is the modern male tragedy. Men wait. They speak like they are asking a stranger for directions. Uncertain. Ambiguous. Calling it "respect." What she feels is absence. The weight of carrying the moment alone. Desire dies in that void.
The feminine does not need your apology. She needs your decision. She wants to feel, without doubt, that you already know what this is, what she is, and what you are there to do. When that signal is clean, when it is not diluted by guilt or cultural fear of masculine clarity, her body doesn’t just open. It offers.
Certainty is not control. Control is insecure. It micromanages and barks. Certainty liberates. It calms the room. It says nothing, and everything rearranges around it.
You’ll know the difference the first time you see it. The change is not subtle. She looks at you differently, touches you differently, stops testing because something in her already decided you won’t collapse. Not soft. Safe. Because you lead.
Anyone can perform confidence. Few men embody direction. When your inner law outlasts the performance, when the show ends and only stillness remains, everything shifts. You stop chasing. You stop explaining. You stop negotiating with an energy that wants to follow.
You lead. And she doesn’t just want to follow. She aches to.
There is a science to surrender. A structure to desire. What people call chemistry is actually calibration. The silent resonance of two complementary forces: dominance held, surrender offered. Not luck. A pattern older than speech. At the center of it is certainty.
The feminine does not initiate. She responds. That is her nature—biologically receptive, craving movement she can trust. Trust is not built on nice words. It is built on presence. When a man moves with uncertainty, her body contracts. She braces and compensates. She knows on a level deeper than language that if you hesitate, she pays the price. It shows up in her hips, her shoulders, a shift in her voice. The system hardens.
When a man moves with command—not arrogance, but clean certainty—her body recognises the signal. Ancient safety. Not soft, solid. She can relax because you will not retreat. She can open because you already decided.
That is when it becomes physical. The body reacts to signal before touch. She gets wet because presence arrived first. Her breath quickens when you step behind her and say nothing because the question has been answered.
She is searching for one answer: Am I safe to surrender here? Safe to drop control, safe to disappear into pleasure, safe to stop thinking and be taken?
That safety comes from certainty. The quiet, grounded message: I’ve got this. Let go.
It comes from a man who leads himself. Who has mastered his appetites. Who moves without requesting approval because his direction isn’t performance, it’s reality.
This is why some women remember certain men for years. Not the looks. Not the money. Not even the acts. It is the imprint certainty leaves. The moment her body surrendered before her mind could catch up. The recognition that she didn’t have to carry anything.
Live at that frequency and you stop seducing. You start leading. She doesn’t only respond. She worships. Not the costume, the law.
I have met a lot of beautiful women, the kind that turn men into fog. Their inboxes are full of performances. Compliments and angles and emojis. When those women stand in front of most men, the men vanish. Their truth dissolves. They start saying whatever they guess she wants to hear. The hope is she will choose them if they are nice enough.
The opposite works. Plain speech. Direct. No sugar. Tell her who you are, how you live, what you expect. Not as a pitch, but as weather. Simple. Neutral. It disorients the modern frame. There are few men who talk like that because there are few men who live like that. The body recognises it as truth.
I don’t hide my reality. I say it early. I have other women. They know each other. Some live with me. They serve the house. I am not saying it to provoke. I am not asking for permission. I am describing the shape of my world. That absence of persuasion is the persuasion. The clarity is the attraction. You can watch it land. Shock, then curiosity.
Why is he like this? How does he hold this much control? Why do I want to follow even as I resist?
They won’t always say it out loud. They test, they hesitate, they pretend it’s anthropological interest. The pattern still plays. Women who never considered themselves open to women. Women who insisted monogamy was non-negotiable. Then, inside a clear container, their bodies tell the truth. Weeks later, they aren’t only accepting another woman in the dynamic. They are initiating it. Offering women as a gift. Loyalty in action.
When she witnesses another woman surrender inches away, it locks something. The frame amplifies. The energy becomes undeniable. Imprinting begins. The nervous system tags the experience as home. It is a power-echo.
I’ve led many women to that place of absolute, flooding release for the first time. Not rare—routine. Women who thought that level of surrender was a myth. Women who had been with competent men, by normal standards, but had never been led to that depth.
The release isn’t only a climax. It is conversion.
After that, she is yours. Not because she says it. Because her biology has confirmed it. The walls didn't just come down; they washed away.
There is a rhythm to it. The voice. The cadence. When to go quiet. When to command. The stillness right at the edge. The exact tone riding the last seconds of her high. Presence, unblinking. Direction without tension. No apology. No collapse.
The energy says: I’ve got you, all of you, and I already decided where this is going.
Once she touches that, she stops comparing you to other men. She stops seeing other men. Looks fade against memory. Bank accounts become background noise. The point is not the sex. The point is that you were the one who unlocked her. The only one who didn’t need to be invited to break the lock.
The tears. The orgasms. The threesomes. The confessions. None of it was spectacle. This is what happens when a man holds such steady command that the feminine finally exhales. The armour drops.
She does not surrender because you made a case. She surrenders because you are immovable. Presence becomes direction. Certainty becomes law. Her chaos, once defensive and wild, finds a place to rest. Not in softness, in you, the man who already decided.
Everything in this manifesto—the polarity, the structure women crave—this is it in the field. She does not surrender to the man. She surrenders to the order he provides. When that order is undeniable, she kneels. Not because she must. Because nothing in her wants to stand.
In the peak madness of Shanghai, M1NT felt like mine. Not on paper. In reality. The field bent when I walked in. The elevator opened on the 24th floor and gravity shifted. Heads turned. Conversations paused. The women responded before I looked at them.
No chase. No persuasion. No games. My reputation preceded me. I already knew where the night was going and who was coming. That was the hook—not charm. Inevitability.
Some nights I would take a girl with a glance and a whisper. No sales pitch. I would guide her into the back rooms behind VIP. Cold marble, bass humming the walls. Seconds later she would be bent over the sink, legs trembling, breath gone. No hesitation. Surrender.
The post-fuck look was always the same. Like no one had ever actually touched her. I had, because I didn’t touch her only with hands. I touched her certainty. I gave her a gift she didn’t know she wanted: the relief of not having to lead. No pacing the interaction, no signalling permission, no babysitting my insecurities. She could finally stop managing the moment.
Leadership in the bedroom is release. You remove the burden she drags through her days. You give her somewhere to put the weight.
Spare me the pearl-clutching. Nothing was taken. It was given, eagerly, breathlessly. The difference was timing. I didn’t guess. I didn’t ask five times. I felt the opening. I stepped like it was already mine because it was.
One night I left early. There was a girl in the back seat. Petite, stunning, new. We had spoken for minutes. She followed without hesitation. I didn’t negotiate reality. I lived it.
She didn’t know there was another woman waiting. I didn’t either, to be honest. We reached my tower. The Milky Way. The name started as a joke and stuck because there is always some truth to a fable. Doors opened. Low light, city humming below. My other woman was on the sofa.
Most men would fumble now. Explain. Apologise. Try a joke. I changed nothing. I sat between them, poured a drink. No panic. No show. Tone set.
The new girl hesitated for a heartbeat. You could feel her mind reach for control. The modern script tried to boot up: Be strong, be guarded, do not surrender.
I let the silence hold. I didn't smile to reassure her. I simply stayed in the pocket of my own reality.
Then, without a word, the woman on the sofa moved closer to me. She didn't look at the new girl; she looked at me. She kissed me—not to perform, but to anchor herself.
That was the switch. The new girl watched the interaction. She saw that the other woman wasn't a victim; she was at peace. The tension in the room vanished. The new girl didn't need to be convinced; she just needed to see that the water was safe.
She didn't say a word. She just dropped her bag, walked over, and sank to the floor beside us. Not because I told her to. But because the gravity in the room was too heavy to stand against.
Surrender doesn’t happen when you command a body. It happens when she feels your frame is safer than her own freedom.
If you want the proof that none of this is theatre, don’t listen to me. Listen to her. The feminine doesn’t surrender for pleasure alone. She surrenders to truth. When she feels law inside one man, when that law becomes her safety, she doesn’t only offer her body. She offers devotion.
















Chapter 7: The Devoted Woman
Most men want a "Ride or Die" woman. The problem is, they usually pick the "Die" part.
They choose women who bring chaos, instability, and drama, mistaking it for passion. They confuse the stress of a toxic relationship with the spark of chemistry. Then, they wonder why they can’t build a business, why they can’t focus, why their energy is constantly being siphoned off to manage the emotional weather patterns of their partner.
A Dominus does not have time for this.
If you are going to build an empire, your woman cannot be another problem you have to solve. She must be the peace you return to. Or, even better, she must be an asset within the architecture itself.
But here is the hard truth: You do not find a devoted woman. You build the environment where devotion is the only logical response.
It started in Bali. That’s where the concept stopped being a theory and became a reality.
I met Naomi there. She didn’t breeze in with drama. She stepped in like she was stepping onto a stage she already knew. Slim-cut black dress. Hair tied back—not to impress, but to get out of the way. Eyes that looked like they had read the room before her body even entered it.
No small talk. No fishing for compliments. We talked for two hours, and it felt like twenty minutes. I didn’t pitch. I didn’t decorate. I just spoke clearly.
When I met her, the potential was obvious. She was sharp, loyal, and capable. She carried a boardroom in her spine. She could do a keynote in a hotel ballroom on five minutes’ notice and have it sound like she wrote it on a mountainside at sunrise. She was built to command.
But she was also scattered. Like a lot of high-energy women, she had a surplus of drive but no vector to pour it into. She was spinning.
In a standard relationship, this energy turns into drama. If a woman is bored, she will manufacture problems just to feel something moving. She will poke at you, test you, and disrupt your work, purely because her nervous system is craving a spike of intensity.
I realised that if I didn’t give her a mission, she would eventually become an obstacle.
So, I didn't just give her a job; I built her a world.
I established AXIS Ethos—a clothing brand designed for the feminine, led by the feminine, but architected by me. I built the walls, the vision, and the aesthetic. I designed the structure of the company just as I design the structure of my life.
Then I handed her the keys and said, "Fill this."
It changed everything.
Now, she doesn't obsess over me; she obsesses over the mission I gave her. She has purpose. She has status. She has a kingdom to manage where her competence is celebrated, but the heavy lifting of the vision remains on my shoulders.
She runs the operations. She manages the talent. She executes the logic. And because she is fulfilled by the work, when we are together, she doesn't need to fight me for attention. She needs me for grounding.
I have peace. And she has the one thing modern feminism promised her but failed to deliver: Legacy.
This is the secret to the "power couple" dynamic that most people get wrong. They think it means two people hustling side-by-side, competing for dominance. No. It means one Architect and one Operator. The Masculine holds the Vision (the axis); the Feminine provides the Motion (the rotation).
Naomi thrives because she knows exactly where the walls are. She knows the standard. She doesn’t have to guess what I want, because I wrote the code for the entire operation.
She kept asking me to add things. Not conditions. Processes. “If you are serious about turning this into a real brand, you need version control on the designs. You need a supply chain that doesn't rely on luck. You need a way to launch without you repeating yourself.”
It is fashionable to say a devoted woman waits around for instructions. People who say that have never had a real one. Naomi moved entire obstacles without asking permission. She made a document structure for the models before I asked. She drew swim lanes on a Notion board like a conductor. She organised the entire inventory system and then told me she would revert in one week with metrics, which made me laugh out loud because who says “revert” about leggings. Someone who helps you win, that’s who.
The first time we fucked it was in the kitchen because I said “come here” while she was still holding a pen. No candles. No playlist. No story for the girls. Just movement. Quiet, clean, like we’d both been doing something else and then the gravity changed. That’s what it is when the devotion is already settled and the bodies catch up.
She made a sound I hadn’t heard out of her mouth before. A noise like a laugh ripped in half, because even in surrender she still wants to have a sarcastic comment loaded. Then she softened so hard the sarcasm left the building and we both stopped thinking for a minute.
She is not a delicate crier. She bites. Marks. Looks you in the eyes like a challenge and then melts when you do not blink. After, she picked up the pen and said “where were we” because of course she did. No drama. Work to do. I loved her more in that moment than any of the forty-six sunsets the island sells you for free.


While AXIS gave her a mission, the Code gave her a rhythm.
In my house, there is a whiteboard. Every morning, the plan is there. The flight times. The gym slots. The dinner reservations. The goals for the quarter.
It is not a suggestion; it is the script.
When a woman wakes up and sees the plan, she relaxes. The burden of choice is removed. She doesn't have to ask, "What are we doing today?" or "Where are we eating?"
Decision fatigue is the enemy of feminine radiance. When you force a woman to make fifty small decisions a day—what to cook, where to go, how to schedule the logistics—she hardens. She has to move into her masculine brain to solve problems.
But when you present the plan? When the structure is visible on the wall? She softens. She trusts. She can focus on being beautiful, on being nurturing, on being present.
With Naomi, the structure is business. With others, the structure is lifestyle.


Then there is Yeye.
If Naomi is the Shield, Yeye is the Hearth.
Yeye is not just a "pretty face." She is elite. A former Miss Thailand winner, a woman who has stood on stages and commanded rooms with nothing but her presence. She understands the currency of beauty at the highest level.
But beneath the sash and the glamour, she possesses a talent that is almost terrifying in its precision. She is a wizard with imagery. She spends hours on Photoshop, refining the "girly" side of the AXIS brand, curating the aesthetic, ensuring that every image, every color, every pixel aligns with the vision. She understands that while I build the structure, she paints the atmosphere.
Yeye is the type of woman who says sorry to the furniture if she bumps into it. Pure softness. Pure flow. She isn’t built for the grind of cold operations; she is built for the aesthetics of living.
Her world before me was improvised. Sleep when she felt like it. Eat when her friends did. Train if a friend dragged her. Work in bursts. Post pretty things online. Wonder why she was tired all the time. She did not need therapy. She needed a schedule.
I sat her at the long table that first night, gave her water, asked her to put her phone away, then built her week in front of her. Hour blocks. Wake at 6:30. Walk before the sun is rude. Cold shower. Journal three lines, not a memoir. Eggs, spinach, meat. Training at ten. Content block for the brand at noon. Read twenty pages at four. Bed by ten. Sunday is reset.
She said “yes” to everything without flinching. I watched her body while we did it. Breathing slowed. Shoulders down. Voice lower. She didn’t argue once. People mistake that for passivity. It is relief.
Day three she tried to sneak a nap at two. I found her on the sofa with a throw over her face like a woman who wants to be invisible and cute at the same time. I pulled the throw, tapped the plan, and said “up.” She stood immediately, hair like a halo, grinning because she loves being caught. Ten minutes later she was outside filming a clip about discipline in a bikini that made two construction workers down the lane hit a wall with a wheelbarrow.
She came in giggling, cheeks flushed, showed me the clip, asked for notes like a student. There is nothing sexier than a woman proud of her own effort. She slept like a stone that night for the first time in months. I know because she told me at 6:31 in the morning with her face pressed into my chest while the alarm was still going. “I do not dream bad things when you tell me what to do,” she said.
That is not just submission. That is a nervous system finding home.
And here is the kicker: She loves the Dominus Code.
You might think a modern beauty queen, a woman with thousands of followers and endless options, would hate the idea of submission. You would assume she wants "empowerment" and "independence."
You would be wrong.
She pushes me to be more dominant, not less. She doesn't want a partner who asks for her opinion on the route; she wants a driver. She reads the concepts I write about—leadership, authority, polarity—and she nods. She champions them.
Why?
Because she wants my children.
She understands biology better than most sociologists. She knows that if she is going to bear children, she needs their father to be a monster to the world and a protector to her. She wants her sons to be strong. She wants her daughters to be safe. She knows that a "nice guy" who negotiates his own existence cannot give her that genetic security.
She pushes for a strong man to guide her because, ultimately, she is vetting me for fatherhood. Every time I lead, every time I set a boundary, every time I refuse to bend, her attraction grows. Not because she is weak, but because she is preparing for the future.
In the AXIS Ethos universe, she represents the ideal—the visual, the spiritual, the soft. She doesn't need to hustle because I have already secured the perimeter. She feels safe enough to just be.
A woman like Yeye calms the nervous system of a man just by being in the room. But she can only do that if you are not asking her to be your mother, your manager, or your business partner.


The modern world tells you to seek an "equal." They mean a roommate. They mean 50/50 bills, 50/50 decisions, 50/50 stress.
I don’t want a roommate. I want a legacy.
When I gave Naomi the keys to AXIS, I wasn’t making her my equal in authority; I was making her my extension in execution. When I protect Yeye from the harshness of the world, I’m not making her weak; I’m allowing her to be soft.
This is what women actually want. They don't want to be the captain of the ship in a storm. They want to be the reason the captain fights so hard to keep the ship afloat.
We have a weekly council. It is not a democracy. It is a report. Each woman speaks to her domain. Food. Training. AXIS Content. Calendar. Travel. We look at what worked and what did not. There are charts. Simple ones. I am not turning my kitchen into a Monday.com ad. We keep score because if you don’t, people lie to themselves.
Yeye keeps the vibe. Naomi keeps the plan. I keep the law. Everyone leaves that table clearer than they arrived. Then we go lift something heavy and eat like kings.
Yeye was the one who suggested we schedule the “free day.” Not a cheat day. A free day. Her words. She said her body obeys better when it knows there is a wild lane on the map. Smart. I added it. Saturdays we eat ridiculous things if we want, film something edgy for the feed if it suits the mood, then fall asleep in a pile like foxes. On Sundays we reset like monks with 40 hour fasts. The balance keeps everyone sane.
I also watched Yeye become protective of the mission. She would DM me profiles of girls and write “pretty but no discipline” or “this one is strong, she will be annoying for two weeks then she will fight for us.” She is weirdly accurate. She screened three women for me without them ever knowing. One made it. One did not. One is still circling like a comet.
Yeye gets a thrill out of bringing feminine assets into our orbit and then seeing me place them in the brand. People call that recruitment when men do it in business. When a woman does it in family, they call it manipulative. They are wrong. It is called building. She is proud of it. So am I.
Then there is the third kind of devotion: the one that leaves.
Her name was Anna. You’ll read the full story of how she tested my frame in a later chapter, but she taught me the most important law of the House: the door must stay open both ways.
A house that traps is a prison. A house that tests, places, and releases with respect is a sanctuary. Anna couldn’t live inside the structure of multiple women, and I wouldn’t dismantle the structure to keep her. We reached a stalemate.
A weak man would have lied to keep her. I let her go. Not as a punishment, but as a placement. She cried in a way that made me want to be twenty percent weaker just to stop the noise in my chest. I didn’t. That is leadership too. Not the flag-waving kind. The slow, adult kind that protects the integrity of a future you will not betray for loud feelings in the present.
But for the women who can accept the frame—for the Naomis and the Yeyes—the reward is absolute devotion.
They don't cheat. They don't wander. They don't look for other options. Why would they?
Out there, in the dating market, men are asking them to split the bill and "go with the flow." Out there, men are asking them, "What do you want to do tonight?"
In here, in my world, there is a mission. There is a brand. There is a whiteboard. There is a King.
People who have never lived it think devotion looks like a girl kneeling while you list rules. That is cosplay. The reality is quieter.
It is a woman making her bed sharp because you do. It is her phone face down because she does not want static in the room. It is a fridge that looks like a plan and not a guess. It is weights put back in the right place. It is water next to your laptop that you did not ask for. It is respect held in small moments nobody will like on Instagram. It is her guarding your time like a lioness with cubs. It is the way she dresses to your taste and then smirks because she knows you noticed without saying anything. It is the way she asks on Tuesday what you want to eat after deadlifts on Friday and then hits the market like a general.


The modern script tells women devotion is weakness. Funny how the loudest critics seem exhausted all the time. A devoted woman is powerful as hell. She is not flapping at a thousand options. She is not always on. She is not addicted to being seen. She has chosen a crown. She wears it quietly. She glows because her energy is not leaking out of fifty open tabs in her nervous system. She is efficient. She is sensual because she is rested. She is rested because she is organised. She is organised because there is a man who holds the line and does not wobble at every mood in the house.
I have no interest in lost girls with Daddy issues. I am not interested in babysitting. I will not be anyone’s coping mechanism. The women who thrive here already have power. Money. Options. If they wanted noise, they could get it by dinner. They choose this because their bodies know the difference between chaos disguised as freedom and peace disguised as control.
The slogans confuse the head. The body never lies.
Pause for a practical bit, because men read this and ask for a template. There isn’t one. There is a standard.
Start with yourself. Your day must be law before you write anyone else’s. Wake at the same time. Train like a man who intends to carry people. Eat like it matters. Work in blocks. Don’t negotiate with your phone. Don’t drip your attention across twelve apps and then pretend you are busy. If your room is chaos, your relationships will be chaos. Clean your room. Then clean your calendar. Then clean your language. Do not promise things you cannot deliver. Do not deliver things you did not promise.
When a woman watches a man who is clean like that for six weeks straight, her body will decide for her. She will either flee because she is addicted to her own storm. Or she will move closer and you will see it in small ways. She will ask you what time you are training, not to join, but to know when to make food. She will text less, not because she is cold, but because she trusts the rhythm. She will start doing small things without asking if you like them. She will stop testing with petty noise. The house will sound different.
That is devotion beginning. If you have to beg for it, you will never keep it.
This is why I built the brand. AXIS is the visible version of the structure, so women who are not inside my house can still orbit the aesthetic and rise from it. It is not a lifestyle guru course. It is clothing. It is kit for a life. We used the golden ratio in the design because I like things that have the decency to be mathematically beautiful. We put Socrates on a wall because the quote isn’t just inspiring. It is operational. Move yourself. Then you get to move the world.
AXIS is for the women who want this aesthetic. But the Code? That is for the men who wish to fill the void of modernity.
And the sex? I will not pretend it isn't part of it, because the internet likes to make adult things sound like crimes.
Devotion is erotic. The kind of erotic that takes your breath because you do not have to manage anything. When a woman has been on time for a week, eaten like a queen, trained like a warrior, and kept her phone out of the bed, the way she opens on Saturday feels like the weekend arriving in your hands.
There is a holiness in it that churches can’t teach because they made the body a problem. It isn’t. It is the place the law becomes warm. We do not film that. We film the sweat before, the food after, the curve of a smile at an airport, the stupid jokes when the ice bath is too cold and Yeye pretends to pass out like a Victorian heroine. We keep the sacred parts for home. Not everything is content. Some things are currency inside a family. Spend them with care.
I will end this one in a small scene because it says everything.
Tuesday night. Rain hard enough to make the pool look like a drum. Power flickered once. In the kitchen the under-cabinet strips washed the island in soft light. Yeye is chopping something green with the concentration of a surgeon. Naomi is at the table with her laptop open, mouth doing that little line she gets when she is solving. I am leaning against the counter watching them operate. No music. The house sounded like work when work is love.
Yeye passed me a sliver of something to taste without looking up. Naomi told me in the same second that the Wednesday content slot needs to move because of a delivery. Both of them moving around me like I am gravity and they are planets that enjoy their orbit.
My phone buzzed with a message from a girl that a year ago would have made my pulse jump. I didn’t open it. I put the phone face down and reached for two glasses. Naomi looked up long enough to catch the gesture. She smiled in that private way she has when she watches me choose the future we said we wanted. Yeye noticed none of it. She was still slicing, then singing under her breath.
The rain got louder. The power held. The plan held. The room felt like a promise kept.
The feminine energy flows like water. Water has no shape. If you pour it on the table, it makes a mess. If you pour it into a vase, it becomes a flower.
Stop complaining that the women in your life are messy. Build the vase. Build the brand. Build the life.
Give her a mission, or she will become your distraction.
I built AXIS Ethos to give my women purpose. I built the Code to give myself power.
And in that order, we both win.






Chapter 8: The Tribe, The Dynasty, The Code
I don’t believe in ghosts. But I do believe in biology. I believe in the code that is written into our DNA, driving us to survive, replicate, and expand. It’s the quiet pressure that sits behind your ribs... Mine drives me every day. Louder since I started writing all this down. The moment you put law into language, the signal gets clear. Like, finally. You’ve been fucking about for years. Now you’re aligned.
That presence doesn’t care about my feelings. It doesn’t clap when I do a podcast. It doesn’t pat my head for trying. It demands. Simple things. Hard things. The kind of things that don’t fit on Instagram. Carry more. Be exact. Don’t lie. Lead. Multiply.
There’s a sentence that sits in my bones now. It arrived once and refused to leave.
Don’t you dare waste what we gave you.
That’s it.
I use it when I’m tempted to coast. When discipline starts to feel boring. When comfort starts dressing itself up as “taking care of myself.” It’s not poetic. It’s a brick. I carry it everywhere.
We talk about legacy like it’s a speech you give when you’re old and rich. It isn’t. Legacy is what your house feels like on a random Wednesday. Legacy is the breakfast your kids get. Legacy is your phone face down because you’re here. Legacy is the woman you choose and the standard you keep. Legacy is the law that outlives your mood.
So this chapter is the map, a view into my future. Its the blueprint I’m building to execute my vision, begin my dynasty, and leave my mark on this World.
Start with the why, because if you get that wrong you’ll build a prison and call it home.
I want scale.
Not because I want to be saluted at dinner like a small dictator. Because one man, one woman, two kids is fragile. One sick day and the whole structure groans. One stressful month and everyone hides in their phones. One argument and there’s no surplus energy to absorb it. You don’t spread stress. You drown in it.
I don’t want a fragile home. I want a fortress.
A fortress isn’t a castle with flags. It’s redundancy. It’s roles. It’s ritual. It’s a system that still works when somebody cries, somebody coughs, somebody quits. It’s the opposite of heroics. It’s boring on purpose, so you get peace for free.
You can’t get that with a “cute little family that will manage somehow.” Not if you’re aiming at ten children raised together so they move like a unit. Not if you want to build a house culture that holds when you’re tired. You need a tribe. You need a plan. You need multiple feminine forces around a single axis that doesn’t wobble.
That axis is me.
Not because I’m better than the women. Because I carry the mission and the consequences. I get the final say. I get the blame. That’s the deal. Authority lives with accountability or it’s cosplay.
One night a woman lay next to me, warm and serious, finger drawing circles on my chest. She said, “Why more than one woman.” Not whining. Not baiting. Asking like an adult.
I could have been soft. “You’re enough.” She was enough. That wasn’t the question.
The question was, will I reduce the mission to fit an emotion. Or will I hold the mission and ask the emotion to grow.
I told her the truth. The easy version is a quiet villa, two kids, Sunday roast, soft kisses in the dark, the slow drift into routine. I can do that. I could be good at it. But it isn’t the plan.
The plan needs scale.
I want ten children, tight in age. Brothers who spar in the same hour and then fight anyone who touches their sisters. Sisters who move like a choir and make every room feel like a secret. I want them to have the same rituals, the same jokes, the same calendar. I want them to remember a childhood that sounded like steps and laughter and someone always being in the kitchen making too much food.
You don’t get that by accident. You design it. You work backward from the outcome. You build the compound, the routines, the law. You place the women like pillars and give each one a domain she can own with pride.
You are not being replaced, I told her. You’re being crowned.
There’s a centre to this. You at the hearth, not the hamster wheel. Not drowning. Not performing your way to exhaustion to prove you’re “modern.” You will have a circle. You will have help. You will have time to be soft without losing respect. If you want to keep pretending you can do it all alone, I’m not your man. If you want to be part of something bigger than your moods, stay.
She stayed.
Here’s what it looks like when it works:
The compound is quiet. Not fake retreat quiet. Working house quiet. Before sunrise, I walk the perimeter with coffee. Gate locked. Dogs fed. Pool still. The staff arrive and melt into their stations because they know the rhythm. Chef checks the board. Driver checks the route. Groundsmen check the generators. This is not a “vibe.” It’s an operation.
In the kitchen, two women and the chef move like a dance. One chops. One cleans. Chef leads. They hum because singing belongs to women in a kitchen and I won’t be shamed out of loving that. On the terrace, one woman runs breathwork with the older kids. Inside, the little ones are making a mess in a controlled zone that looks like chaos and is actually a plan. No iPads. No TV. Paper. Pencils. Blocks.
I walk in and the energy doesn’t spike. It settles. Not fear. Orientation. Things line up without noise. There’s a small chorus of “morning, Papa” because respect can be warm. We eat together. Blessing is short. Eyes up. Phones down. People who think this is authoritarian have never eaten dinner with a family who truly love each other. Law and laughter aren’t enemies. They make each other possible.
After breakfast, day flows.
Everyone knows their lane. Roles are not cages. They are clarity. The women chose their domains. We built them around skills and temperament, not stereotypes and memes. One runs education. One runs food. One runs home and health. One runs content. One runs culture and ceremony. They overlap. They cross-train. But there is a name on every responsibility so nothing falls through cracks and becomes “somebody should have.”
My job is the vision and the execution. I keep the horizon clear. I make the calls when tradeoffs bite. I protect the standard. I never hide. I do not outsource discipline to a tired woman because I’m on a call. If a boy needs correction, he gets it from me. Calm. Immediate. No speeches. Then a hand on the shoulder when it’s done so he learns that law is love, not rage.
People ask where jealousy goes. It doesn’t get “healed” by poetry. It gets placed. Jealousy is a sensation. It isn’t a strategy. A woman can feel it and still behave. She doesn’t get to use it to blow the doors off the house. If she needs to cry, she can cry with her sisters and return clean. The women are not rivals. They are a circle. That doesn’t happen by accident either. I foster it. I reward it. I do not allow poison to stay long enough to speak a language.
You want details. Good. Here.
Foundation Principles
Write it. Frame it. Live it. Ours fits on one page.
* Truth over comfort. If it must be said, say it early.
* Phones out of meals and beds.
* The house is orderly by nightfall. No dish left.
* Wake times are fixed. Sleep is sacred.
* Exercise daily. Movement is medicine.
* Money is a tool. Tools are maintained. No private chaos spending.
* Children are welcomed everywhere, but adults are adults. Don’t negotiate with a tantrum.
* Public respect, private correction.
* Sex is private. Affection is public. The house should feel warm to walk through.
* The mission is bigger than the moment.
When new problems appear, we don’t invent random fixes for the mood. We test it against the page. If we need to add something, we add it once, not five different exceptions with everyone secretly bending.
Roles and Domains
Stop pretending a house runs itself. It’s a company with love as the P&L. We map domains with the same seriousness I map my businesses.
* Food and Nourishment. Menu planning. Sourcing. Prep. Macros. Seasonal cycles. One woman owns it with the chef. She can delegate. She can’t abdicate.

* Education. Curriculum. Tutors. Reading list. Sports coaching. Field work. The older kids teach the younger on Fridays. Everyone learns to teach because leadership without pedagogy is noise.

* Health and Home. Sleep. Hygiene. Protocols. Sick bay setup. Supplies. First aid. Cold plunge schedule. Sauna rotation. Yes, we schedule recovery. Chaos doesn’t get a say because the plan was made when everyone was calm.

* Culture and Ceremony. Birthdays. Rites of passage. Festivals. Family council. House story archive. Photos tagged and filed. Our crest on things that matter. You think that’s corny. You’ll change your mind when your five-year-old draws the crest without help and explains what it means.

* Content and External. Brand calendar. Creator days. Guest handling. Legal. Non-disclosure. Crisis comms. If you think this doesn’t belong in a family, you haven’t lived one that is watched.

* Ops. Me. Security. Finance. Expansion. Dispute resolution. Law maintenance. Succession.
Each domain has a standard operating rhythm. Daily, weekly, monthly. Quick standups. A weekly council after dinner on Sundays. Thirty minutes. Wins. Frictions. Decisions. No monologues. Everyone leaves knowing the next steps. Then we switch off the board, put on music, and remember we’re not a tech company.
Education
The school system will not build you a dynasty. It was designed to make compliant citizens, not competent families.
We teach inside and outside.
   * Inside. Mornings. Core literacies. Reading. Writing. Numbers. Logic. Rhetoric. Memory work. Languages. Daily recitation. Not to turn them into robots. To give them a brain that obeys. Tablets? Tools, not tutors. If a kid can’t sit still for thirty minutes without a screen, you fix that before you chase “gifted.”

   * Outside. Afternoons. Workshops. Trades. Coding with someone who can build a product. Cooking with the chef. Carpentry with the bloke who built the table you’re eating on. Animals. Garden. Engines. Electricity. If your child can diagram a sentence but can’t wire a plug, don’t lecture me about “well rounded.”

   * Sport. Non-negotiable. Combat sport for boys and girls. Team sport for learning to pass the ball. Solo sport for owning your discipline. Compete. Lose. Learn. If they cry, they still shake hands.

   * Art. Music in the house. Not as a hobby. As a language. Everyone picks an instrument. Everyone learns to sing at least one song decently for a family night. It bonds. It breaks the weird awkwardness most families carry like a curse when someone asks them to speak in front of others.

   * Faith and Philosophy. Not dogma. Exposure. Myth, scripture, history of ideas. We read Marcus and Moses and Miyamoto Musashi and Montaigne. Kids don’t need to believe what I believe. They need to know how belief is built.
Money and Governance
Money is not love, but it is oxygen. Starving a house to prove a point is stupid.
      * The Family Hold. One legal vehicle sits above personal assets. Clear operating agreements. Dividends. Veto rights. If you put your house on vibes, a judge will run your life when you’re emotional.

      * House Budget. OpEx like a company. Food. Staff. Education. Health. Maintenance. Fun. Charity. Everyone sees the numbers at the council once a month. Kids too when they’re old enough. Money becomes normal. Not a secret or a weapon.

      * Work. The women can work. Some will. Some won’t. No one is shamed for choosing home. No one is worshipped for choosing a laptop. The question is, does your work strengthen the house or steal from it. Be honest. Adjust.

      * Succession. If I die, there’s a binder. It has passwords, documents, contacts, backups. The house law continues under a council of three. One woman. The oldest capable son. A trusted external who loves us and has no inheritance motive. They hold until a leader is clear. We do not crown based on age. We crown based on embodiment.

      * Dispute Resolution. Two chairs. One bell. One rule. Speak only to the person in front of you. No triangulation. No public performance. We do it fast. We do it small. Drama dies if you starve it early.
Symbols
People laugh at crests until they see their child draw one from memory.
We designed ours on a napkin then handed it to someone who can draw better than me. The axis in the centre. Two lions. A laurel. A small star for each child as they arrive. Motto underneath. Not Latin for the sake of it. English that we mean.
The crest goes on books, on belts, on the door of the central room. It goes on the ring the boys receive at eighteen. On the necklace the girls get when they complete their first solo project. It isn’t a brand. It’s a reminder. Carry the line.
Discipline
I’m not a screamer.
A house that is constantly shouted at is a house where the leader has no gravity. Discipline is simple. Immediate. Fair. Known in advance.
         * Break a small law, you get a small correction. Extra chore. Loss of privilege. You apologise properly, not “sorry if.” You fix what you broke.

         * Break a big law, you get a big correction. Remove a phone. Remove a trip. Add a task that costs sweat. Sit with me for an hour and write what you will do instead next time. You read it out loud at council. Not to shame. To anchor.

         * Repeat offenders meet the consequence ladder. You know the next step before you choose. Freedom returns just as fast as you embody the standard. We do not punish longer than necessary to regain order. We are not jailers. We are builders.
I hug my sons after I correct them. I hold my daughters until their breathing slows when they’ve done something stupid and feel ashamed. Shame is not the enemy. Perpetual shame is. We move it through the body and then we get back to living.
The Women
People love to imagine the women as ornaments. Come visit and say that out loud. You’ll adjust your tone.
Each woman is formidable. Each has authority within her domain. They report up, not because they are less, but because someone must hold the whole.
I do not sleep with everyone at once like a clown. I am precise. I guard my energy. I give attention like a craftsman, not a drunk. I do not compare women to each other. I compare them to the standard we agreed on. I do not gossip to one about another. That is poison. I do not promise more than I can deliver. That is cowardice.
The women protect each other from outsiders and from their own worst habits. They call each other out before I have to. That is how I know the culture is strong. I praise them for that in front of everyone so the behaviour repeats.
And when a woman can’t live here, I help her leave well. No bitterness. No smear campaigns. We have a ritual for departures. We tell the truth to the house. We honour what was good. We bless what is next. Adults end things clean.
The Children
A dynasty is not trophies on a shelf. It’s the quality of your children’s nervous systems. If they grow up jittery, ashamed, confused, you failed even if your Instagram looks regal.
We teach them to speak. To look adults in the eye without that weird modern flinch. To shake hands like they can be trusted. To say “I don’t know” without collapsing. To fight and stop when told. To take compliments with a “thank you” not a self-deprecating monologue. To serve at table. Yes, serve. Your hands are not a burden.
We tell them stories. Real ones. The night we lost power in Reading because I thought I was an electrician in flip-flops. The time I nearly lost the business because I was too busy being a DJ. The time I told a woman I loved that I wouldn’t bend the law and watched her leave. They learn from my scars so they don’t need to collect the same ones to prove they are men.
We protect their innocence without making them stupid. Innocent does not mean ignorant. Innocent means uncorrupted. Their first glimpses of sex should be love they can feel through a wall, not a stranger’s body on a phone at midnight. Their first taste of alcohol is with me at a table, a tiny sip, a talk about choice, not a binge in a car park because everything is forbidden and therefore exciting.
The Compound
Location matters. The shape of a place teaches.
I am building around courtyards because a courtyard is a heart. Rooms open to it. People cross it. You can see each other without having to shout down corridors. There is a school room with windows that open onto the garden so the kids don’t learn that learning is fluorescent lighting and a clock that won’t move. There is a hall that belongs to the House. Long table. Flags for our crest and for the places our blood came from. A wall of photos that isn’t a brag. It’s a memory.
Gym is non-negotiable. I don’t tuck it in a garage like a guilty habit. It’s central. The kids see it. The women use it. Visitors understand without being told. We build bodies here. We don’t apologise for it.
There is a chapel. Call it what you want. Quiet room. Prayer room. Still room. We don’t force belief. We force silence. Five minutes a day minimum. No phones. Sit. Breathe. Listen. If you can’t be still for five minutes, you shouldn’t be making any decisions that matter.
Kitchen is big. Dangerous. Knives sharp. Fire real. Children learn to respect both. We don’t baby-proof the world. We proof the children.
Staff are family with contracts. That means respect is daily not sentimental. We pay on time. We set boundaries. We train. We do not create little mini tyrants by letting a loved staff member bend the law because they’re “like an auntie.” If I travel, security boosts. We don’t advertise schedules. We live as if someone is always watching because someone is.
The Blueprint for Others
You don’t have to want ten children. You might not be built for multiple women. You might want the smallest version of this with one woman and three kids and a dog that farts at dinner. Fine. The code still applies.
Axis. Law. Roles. Ritual. Rhythm. That’s it.
Make your own crest. Write your own seven-line creed. Put a white board in the kitchen and stop pretending things will happen by vibes. Build a weekly council. Light a candle at dinner if you need to mark the day. Put your phone away. Go to bed on time. Wake up at the same time. Train. Read out loud to your kids for fifteen minutes a night and you will beat 90 percent of homes by accident.
If you cannot lead a house of three, you cannot lead a house of thirty. Start small. Start now. Stop writing drafts of your standards in your head. Put them on paper. Tell the people you love. Live them for two weeks. Adjust. Repeat.
The Dynasty
People imagine dynasties as yachts and chandeliers. They forget how they start.
They start with a man who chose his vision over mood on a Tuesday. They start with a woman who chose trust over drama on a Friday. They start with a child who watched both and thought, “that’s how we do it,” and then carried it into a life you will never see.
Fifty years from now I want my daughters at a table with my other daughters and nobody in the room wondering if they belong. I want my sons to argue about ideas while they oil a hinge. I want grandsons to teach nephews how to lift. I want granddaughters to teach nieces how to set a table like a ceremony. I want our crest to mean something outside our house because our house made the street around it calmer. You think that’s grand. It isn’t. It’s local.
When I die, I want one line said honestly.
He never flinched.
Not he was perfect. Not he never cried. Not he never made a fool of himself. He just didn't flinch.
Through boredom. Through insult. Through the long, dry seasons where nobody clapped. He stayed focused until it caught. He stayed focused until his children could carry it. He stood fast so his women could rest. He stood fast so his sons could stand. He stood fast so his daughters could choose worthy men.
That’s the tribe. That’s the dynasty. That’s the code.
Build it like it matters. Because it does.
Chapter 9: Blood and Balance Sheets
Most people won’t shut up about their wins. They replay the tidy exits, the “called it” trades, and the greatest hits reel they edit in their head so they can pretend success was inevitable.
Legacy isn’t built on wins; it’s built on scar tissue. It is built on the losses that cut you open, the misreads that force you to be honest, and the pain that sharpens the edge you arrogantly thought was already sharp.
I’ve made millions, and I’ve lost millions. Each loss left a mark I still use today.
After I sold Dedipower, I thought I had the code cracked. I had tens of millions, no debt, and nobody to answer to, so I sought calm and predictability. I did exactly what clever newly rich men do when they want to be “sensible”: I parked cash in London property. We set up proper structures, BVI entities, accountants nodding in expensive rooms, and lawyers smiling at the fees. For a while, it felt very adult. Then I realised the problem wasn’t my plan; it was the soil.
Britain had started to rot, and I hadn’t noticed.
I grew up believing in the British operating system—not the politicians, but the culture itself: the rule of law, the boring consistency, the idea that it was a good place to raise kids. But after 2015, the screws came loose. Brexit wasn’t the issue for me; the failure to follow through was. We took the economic cost but kept the bureaucratic paperwork, ending up with the worst of both worlds.
Then envy crept in like damp. It became a slower, softer country where producers were treated like suspects and the rich were labelled villains. I watched a nation of builders turn into professional hall monitors. If you try to play a clean strategy on a poisoned pitch, the pitch wins every time. I was parking wealth in a place that had started to resent wealth, and that isn’t prudence—that’s slow suicide.
I tried chasing yield next. I lent a million to a friend at ten percent with two years of interest. He went broke, I went to court, and I clawed back about half after spending even more on legal fees. The lesson was blunt: When a man needs your money to prove he isn’t finished, don’t be his proof. Let him prove it without you.
The bigger hit was sinking two million into a crowdfunded lending platform run by a man I used to know from the Dedipower days. The pitch was perfect—bridge loans, tangible collateral, low risk—but behind the curtain, it was ghost borrowers and pretend valuations. It collapsed, and I’m still chasing scraps. That one hurt more because I ignored the warning signs out of loyalty, and loyalty is beautiful right up until the moment it blinds you.
Then came Shanghai and Horizon. I already owned the energy at M1NT—I didn’t own the company, but I owned the room, the status, and the eyes. Horizon was pitched as an upgrade, a new concept with new leverage. The truth is simpler: I wanted more women and dressed it up as “opportunity.” The numbers were a fig leaf for my ego. The club failed, and I lost the lot. Not because I was unlucky, but because I was high on my own myth. When you start believing your own press, your bank account is usually the one that gets punished.
And then there was Lombok.
For years, I looked at that investment as a failure. I bought land by a planned MotoGP track based on drone footage and promises, only to spend years suing a ghost. It sat there like a gravestone—technically worth something, but actually doing nothing. No income, no joy, just dead weight.
But the universe has a strange sense of timing.
As I evolved, the purpose of that land evolved with me. What was once a mistake is now becoming the cornerstone of my legacy. I am planning to build a Performance Lab & Retreat there called NØDE.
This isn’t just a gym; it’s a physical manifestation of the network theory we operate on. Strategic nodes in a global wellness lattice. Shared operational excellence. It will be designed using Sacred Geometry—fractal efficiency in space utilization that creates intuitive navigation and psychological harmony.
We are moving beyond fitness into complete human optimization. Physical peak performance, mental clarity, and financial wellness all calibrated under one roof. It seems with every cloud there is a silver lining, provided you wait long enough to build the right architecture underneath it.
All of these failures had the same root: I had no one to ask. I had no older pirate who’d built, lost, and built again. My parents didn’t come from money, so I trusted friends and my own speed. I moved fast and mistook that for mastery, which you can do when you’re hungry and unknown, but when you’re wealthy and loud, it becomes expensive.
Eventually, the lessons stuck. Don’t rush. Don’t invest just because you're excited. Don’t chase yield that looks a bit too shiny. Don’t call ego “vision.” I’m still risk-on by nature, but now I only play hands I can actually win. I pick battlefields that respect strength. That’s why I build in Bali, Africa, Dubai—not because they’re soft, but because they still reward clarity and pressure. You don’t build a dynasty in a dying kingdom.
I’ve built with brothers and bled with brothers. I’ve seen envy wearing loyalty’s clothes, and I’ve seen good men fail because they couldn’t hold the pace. But I’ve also watched other men—the ones I respect—adapt mid-fall, bleed, and build anyway. Those are the men whose opinions I actually hear.
Ryan is one of those. I’ve known him for thirty years—same school, same crew.
We built EngageTech together. I didn’t just name it; I provided the startup blueprint. He had the industry bones, but he needed the push. I gave him the inspiration—and the confidence—to quit his safe job and step into the fire. It worked.
I didn’t stay long as an operator because my life then was Shanghai, decks and late nights, so I moved to a non-exec seat. Ryan didn’t just keep it alive; he scaled it. He doesn’t talk about building; he builds. That’s why he’s still in my phone.
In one of my weaker moments, I sold my shares in EngageTech for dirt cheap. The business is now worth over $30m USD. Financially, that stings. But strategically, it confirmed a core truth of the Dominus Code: Power comes from making your circle strong.
I was the catalyst. I pushed him to build when he was comfortable. That company changed his life. I might have missed the cheque, but I secured the man. Ryan respects me massively—not just because we have history, but because I helped make him rich. He will answer my call forever now. That is a form of equity that doesn’t show up on a cap table, but it pays out for decades.
Fast forward to now: I’m working on a Bitcoin and AI infrastructure play, with our first site in Africa, backed by real money and a big PE firm on the cap table. This isn’t a side hustle you brag about on LinkedIn; it’s a machine that will exit heavy if we execute properly.
Kane is one of my partners on this. Honest, big heart, and reads people like I read spreadsheets. He comes from a place where being liked kept doors open, whereas I come from a mode where leverage kicked doors in.
Kane is a Utopian.
He believes in the inherent good of people; he wants to save the one child today even if it risks the hundred tomorrow. I am the Realist; I guard the seed corn. He thinks my tone is sharp, and I think his pace is soft. We’re both right in our own ways, but he’s learning that in this game, cadence is king.
We actually met years ago at M1NT. He came to my table a bit dazzled and flashed his watch like a passport—three to five grand, a family piece that meant something to him. I nodded and let my hundred-grand piece catch the light. No words were spoken, but that was the conversation. Not cruelty, just calibration. Men need those moments—the sting that wakes you up. I barely wear that watch now because it gives me the ick, but back then I loved it. He learned from it: respect, not envy.
I messaged Ryan recently and told him I wanted Kane to sit with him. I want him to see form up close—the pace, the pressure, the boring bits that make empires. Ryan gets it. Kane will get it, either the easy way or the hard one.
I struggle with advice from men who haven’t carried weight. Not because money is god, but because money has gravity. It changes timing, it changes your appetite, and it makes your words heavier because they were paid for. I am trying to be better at hearing brains without a balance sheet behind them, but it’s not natural for me. I listen better if you’ve bled. If you haven’t, you’re background noise until proven otherwise. It’s an ugly truth, but it’s the truth.
Kane earns his seat because he brings something I don’t. He bonds rooms. He can feel the "no" behind the "yes" and save weeks of negotiation. He brought me the Africa opportunity in the first place, and that value is undeniable.
Victor is the other edge of the triangle. We met during my unhinged era in LA at the Supper Club. I told my friend Jerry, who managed the place, that I’d buy the twelve-litre Dom if I could descend from the ceiling in that cage. He said yes because of course he did. Star Wars theme, lights, silence—I came down holding twenty grand of champagne like a budget deity. Victor looked up and asked, “Who the fuck is this white guy?”
Perfect. I even have a photo to prove it.
We rolled that chaos to my villa in a stretched Hummer that got stuck going up the windy roads of Hollywood Hills, so I walked twenty Vietnamese girls up the steep inclines like a tour guide. Monty was already in the hot tub in his speedos. He was meant to split the thirty grand bill but refused, calling it the worst night of his life. Then we found a video of him spraying champagne across a girl’s chest like he’d won Monaco. We still laugh about it. That was my world then. Victor didn’t flinch, and that’s why he’s still in it.
Back in Shanghai, we ran GPU rigs in the basement of his French Concession mansion while the upstairs hosted China’s elite. Ethereum was five dollars, and we were printing tens of thousands a week. When ETH hit one fifty, I did the sensible adult thing and sold a big tranche to buy a two million pound London flat. ETH then did what ETH likes to do and went vertical again. London softened. Being smart doesn’t make you rich; being right long enough does.
When Kane brought Uganda, Victor was the first call. He doesn’t flinch, he doesn’t moralise, and he executes under load. That’s the man you want when the wires get hot.
This is what legacy really looks like. It isn’t clean or tidy. It is messy, loud, sometimes embarrassing, and completely unstoppable when the right men lock in.
When the weight sits heavy on my shoulders, I think of my dad.
He is a good man—honest, athletic, and kind. He never missed weekends, gave me sport, and installed a competitive engine in me. But he didn’t have the map I needed for this world. His dad died when he was ten, and he was sent to boarding school. On his first day, he asked who the best tennis player was, beat a boy six years older, and then got beaten up for months because of it. He learned to keep his head down. He missed Amazon stock when it could have changed his life. Caution shaped him.
I’m not that. I jump. That’s why I’m here. But my first jump was only possible because he handed me £3,000 when I needed it for the first servers. No hesitation, just belief. When I went off course later—ego louder than sense, removed from my own business—he showed up again. My parents even united for that one stretch. He used his network and found us a chairman who helped scale Dedipower beyond my imagination. That was my father’s legacy in action: quiet, unfancy, but essential.
Here’s the confession: I’ve struggled to respect him properly because I’ve got a broken reflex that measures men by money. If you haven’t carried heavy financial loads, I discount you without even knowing I’m doing it. He didn’t deserve that from me. He built my spine in the only way he knew how: stability, kindness, humility. I lead better than he ever could, but I don’t love half as well. That’s on me.
Maybe that’s why I’m building a system for my own children. Not just capital, but Code. I want them to never have to guess. I want them to feel the fire and know where it came from, inheriting more than a balance sheet—inheriting a cadence.
Most men think legacy is stuff—a house, a car, a company. That’s debris. Real legacy is architecture, momentum, and calibration. It’s the way your children move when nobody is watching. I don’t want them to only have wealth; I want them to have direction. I want instinct that points true because they grew up inside a house where truth had a shape.
My sons shouldn’t need to rebel to feel like men. They’ll breathe masculinity every morning at breakfast. It will sit in the way I speak and the way I keep my word when no one is clapping. My daughters will grow up with a man who commands without cruelty. They’ll smell a soft liar at the door and shut it, not because I told them to, but because they lived the reality.
That’s legacy to me. Not that they remember my name, but that the code still lives when I’m gone.
Chapter 10: The Phalanx
A King cannot rule from an island.
You can have the discipline of a monk, the body of a Spartan, and the harem of a Sultan, but if you are standing alone when the world pushes back, you will fall.
History does not remember the "Lone Wolf." That is a Hollywood myth invented to make lonely men feel better about their lack of social skills. History remembers the Phalanx.
The Phalanx was the Greek military formation where every man stood shoulder to shoulder, shield overlapping shield. It worked because it was a single, impenetrable organism. If one man stepped back, the line broke. If one man was weak, the man next to him died.
This is the standard for the men in your life.
Most men do not have a Phalanx. They have "mates." They have drinking buddies. They have people they have known since school who are essentially liabilities disguised as history. These men are not shields; they are leaks. They drain your time, they lower your average, and they anchor you to a version of yourself that you are trying to kill.
If you are serious about the Dominus Code, you must audit your circle with the same ruthlessness you audit your balance sheet. You cannot build a dynasty on a foundation of nostalgia.
I have a simple rule: You are the average of the five men you are afraid to disappoint.
Read that again. Not the men you "hang out" with. The men whose respect you are terrified of losing. If you are the smartest, richest, and most disciplined man in your room, you are in the wrong room. You are not being challenged; you are being worshipped. And worship makes you soft.
Throughout my life, I have had to learn the difference between a friend who kills time and a brother who conquers territory. I have walked through fire with many men. Some came out the other side with me, hardened and ready for the next war. Some stayed in the fire, consumed by their own refusal to evolve. And some decided to stay home, lock the doors, and pretend the fire didn’t exist at all. I have learned as much from the men I left behind as I have from the men I kept.
To build a true Phalanx, you must understand the archetypes of men who will enter your orbit. You need the Brother, the Challenger, the Disruptor, and the Warning. I have them all.
The Loyal Paradox
Let’s talk about Victor. If I called Victor today and told him I needed a body moved, or a sum of money held, he would do it. I trust him implicitly with my life and with my capital.
We met during the wildest days in LA and Shanghai. He saw me descend from the ceiling of the Supper Club in a cage with twelve liters of Dom Pérignon, and he didn't blink. Later, in the shark tank of Chinese business, when we were running GPU rigs and navigating the grey zones of crypto, he never wavered on a deal. When our operations expanded and then contracted, when money was lost and stress was high, he honoured every agreement we had. He paid back what he owed. In a world of snakes, that kind of integrity is rare, and I value it deeply.
But Victor is a paradox. He possesses the connections of a diplomat and the heart of a lion, yet he is trapped in a loop. He is tied up in endless, labyrinthine family money issues with the Chinese government, a bureaucratic nightmare that has consumed his mental bandwidth for years. Instead of cutting the knot, he lives inside it, often medicating the stress with alcohol and the comfort of a "network."
He is a warning to me, not because he is a bad man—he is a great man—but because he has bought into a dangerous philosophy. His mantra is that "Input is not important; Output is the only marker." He looks at his wealthy friends—men who seemingly made millions with ease—and he thinks he can emulate their results without emulating their hidden grind. He believes his unique skill is "the network." Going to dinners. Shaking hands. Being the guy who knows the guy. He tells himself he is working hard because he is always busy, always moving, always talking.
But deep down, he knows it is a trap. You cannot cheat the law of exchange. You cannot output excellence if you are inputting mediocrity. In business, "working smart" is usually just an excuse for lazy men to avoid the heavy lifting. Victor wants the harvest without the season of plowing. I keep him close because his loyalty is absolute, but I watch his philosophy closely to remind myself: Integrity is essential, but without the grind, it is just a loyal passenger on a stationary ship.
The Anchor
Then there is Monty. I have known him since we were ten years old. We are cut from the same cloth but stitched into completely different shapes. If I am the risk, Monty is the hedge.
Monty is the definition of the "Normal Life." He lives in Guildford. He has a lovely wife, a beautiful home, and 2.4 children. He is a wonderful father, truly present and dedicated. He wants to give his children the push he had, the discipline he learned early but somewhere along the way decided to trade for safety.
We were competitive from the start. People look at him now—an analyst in the City, a bit miserable, tight with money—and they wouldn’t guess that he used to be a machine. He was the number two swimmer in England for the under-sixteens in butterfly. That is not a casual hobby. That is training every morning before school, lungs burning, staring at a black line on the bottom of a pool while other kids were sleeping. He knows what suffering feels like.
But fear got him. He is afraid of the world. He has become a "NIMBY"—Not In My Back Yard. He looks at the decay of the UK, the eroding culture, the creeping cancer of societal collapse, and he closes the curtains. He figures that if he keeps his head down, pays his taxes, and doesn't make a fuss, the crocodile will eat him last.
Our friendship is the longest thread in my life, but it has knots in it. We started Dedipower together above that tyre shop. We were boys trying to be men. But when the pressure mounted, he made a choice. He wanted out. He went to university to pursue the "safe" path, while Craig and I stayed in the trenches. We changed the share structure to reflect the work we were doing, and he never really forgave that. He felt aggrieved.
We healed it, eventually. Recently, I sold him the remainder of my stake in EngageTech dirt cheap. He is going to make a fortune from them. I did it sub-consciously. I wanted to reset the balance. I wanted to kill the ghost of the past so we could just be friends again.
And we are. We balance each other. He looks at my life—the travel, the women, the risks, the "Crazy Uncle" energy I bring to his kids—and I know he lives vicariously through me. I look at his stability, and for a split second, I envy the quiet. He sees me training, sees the Dominus standard, and because he is competitive, the swimmer is waking up. He is working out. He is losing the gut. I provide the voltage; he provides the ground.
The Brother in Arms
Then there is Ryan. We haven’t just known each other a long time; we have been in the trenches together since we were schoolboys. This isn't a mentorship; it's a brotherhood forged in decades of competition.
We were fiercely competitive growing up, especially in sport. He was a great cricketer—arguably a far better natural player than I was—until a nasty bowl knocked his front tooth out and ended his career. But here is the stat I always remind him of: despite him being the "better" player, he never got a century.
I got two.
That’s the dynamic. We push each other. We keep score.
We remained close through everything. I didn't "find" him later in life; I was right there when he was working as an estate agent at Foxtons and then at Target 250. He was doing well, but I saw he was playing a game too small for his engine. I pushed him. I convinced him to level up. We launched EngageTech, and I provided the spark, but he built the fire.
Today, he is a serious operator. He runs a business with over 150 staff, has three wonderful children, and holds it all down while paying serious tax in the UK. He works like a dog.
I never had a mentor; I always felt I had to figure it out alone. Ryan is the same. But, he knows how to listen, learn, and adapt far greater than I do, it turns him into a beast.
Like many of my friends, he comes from a broken home, so his focus on his own family is absolute. He is breaking the cycle in real-time.
I look at him now, and I see a machine. I see a man who balances the grind with the family life in a way that commands respect. We talk business constantly, and frankly, I learn as much from him as he does from me. It is a relationship of equals. Two men, different lanes, same altitude.
The Redemption
You cannot build a future if you are afraid of your past. That brings me to Craig (Dedipower). The man I started it all with. Hyper-intelligent, heavily introverted, and frankly, a bit of a social nightmare back then. We were young, arrogant, and under immense pressure. We fell out massively.
I remember marching him to an ATM when we were teenagers, forcing him to withdraw £300 so I could buy an amplifier for my bedroom speakers because I felt he owed me. He even tried to oust me from the business once with a press release. We were at war.
I hated him for years. But looking back, I realise 50% (if not more) of that toxicity was me. I was distracted, chaotic, and difficult. He was trying to keep the servers running while I was trying to be a star.
Today, we don’t talk much, but the bond is strong. I know I can trust him with my life. I owe him for the wealth I have. Dedipower wouldn’t have exited without his brain. A Dominus must be able to look back at his enemies and realise which ones were actually just mirrors showing him his own flaws. I apologize to him in these pages. We bled together, we fought each other, and we both won. That is a brotherhood that survives silence.
The Disruptor
You need a man in your circle who carries a grenade. For me, that is another Craig, wildly different from the Dedipower one.
He is the anti-Monty. While Monty hides (or low key has had figured out there is nothing he can do about it) from the state of the world, Craig screams at it. He is a creative, a little crazy, and utterly fearless. During COVID, he stood his ground when the world went mad. He refused the vaccine, took the heat, and didn’t flinch. Now, he feels vindicated, and boy doesn’t he like to tell us.
He is into conspiracy theories, which, let’s be honest, usually turn out to be true six months later. We align politically because we are both Realists. He isn’t afraid to upset people in the short term for the greater good of the long term. That is a quality I respect. It is why I like Trump. It is why I like Craig.
If I were running a country, he would be my right hand. Not because he is polished, but because he cannot lie. He has a touch of "Tourette’s"—he says the thing you are not supposed to say, and he says it loud. But the bond runs deeper than politics.
I am the Godfather to his daughter, Bea. Whenever I go back to the UK, his kids climb all over me like I’m a climbing frame. He loves fiercely, hates dishonesty, and lives with his chest out. You need a man like that to remind you that being "civilized" is often just being tamed.
The Mirror
Clinton is my reflection in a different glass. We met in the Shanghai glory days, and let's just say we lived it to the absolute limit. We weren't just attending parties; we were the engine of them. We spent most of those nights hanging out the back of Chinese girls, lost in the hedonism of a city that never told us "no."
He is hyper-intelligent, an extrovert, and now a very senior executive at Apple. He makes serious money and has a brain that hums at my frequency. We hiked Big Sur together, just two men in the wild, and it was one of the few times I felt completely normal. He validates my "crazy." When I tell him my plans, he doesn’t look at me like I’m insane; he looks at me like I’m ambitious.
But we fight on one thing. And it is a fight I refuse to lose. Legacy.
Clinton comes from a disconnected family background—he doesn't know his father, isn't connected to his mother—and because of that, he decided early on that the line ends with him. He never wanted children.
For years, I have been waging a war against that decision.
I tell him constantly: "It is your duty."
This isn't about what he "wants" in the moment. It is about what he owes to the future. You cannot have genes that good—an intellect that sharp, a drive that relentless, a capacity for success that places you in the top 0.01%—and let it die with you. That is not a lifestyle choice. It is a crime against evolution.
Nature spent millions of years refining the DNA that sits inside him. It survived wars, famines, and plagues to produce a man capable of operating at the highest level of modern society. To take that genetic lottery ticket and throw it in the bin because you "like your freedom" is the ultimate act of selfishness.
I push him on it every time we speak. I tell him that his legacy isn't the code he ships at Apple. It isn't the stock options. It isn't the hiking trips. Those fade. Blood remains.
Recently, for the first time, I have seen a crack in the armor. He has started to think about it. He is beginning to see that freedom without a future is just a waiting room for death. That is my mission with him: to convince him that he must become the father he never had, rather than letting the absence of one define his end.
I will keep pushing until he holds a son. That is what brothers do.
The Challenger
Dirk is the new guard. A giant Dutchman, ex-tennis player, living the Dubai life. You need a friend like Dirk because he is one of the few men who is completely unafraid to tell me to fuck off.
He calls me out on my bullshit constantly, not just in business, but in life. He acts as a regulator for my ego. The golf course is just the venue where it happens most often. I have a terrible habit of throwing clubs when I hit a bad shot. Dirk stood on my putting line once, and when I told him to move, he told me to get lost. I respected that instantly.
One afternoon, we were out on Dirk’s boat by the Dubai World Islands fishing with a couple of beauties. We were cruising, sun shining, vibes perfect. Then, I started talking.
I started explaining the concepts of this book—Polarity, the Dominus, the biological necessity of masculine leadership. Dirk went white. He started physically waving his hands at me, whispering aggressively, "No, no, no! Don't say anything! Shut up, Spencer! You're going to ruin it!"
He was terrified. He thought I was going to "cancel" us in the middle of the ocean. He thought I was dropping a nuclear bomb of misogyny that would make the girls swim back to shore.
But the girls didn’t recoil. They leaned in. Their eyes glazed over—not with boredom, but with that specific, heavy-lidded look a woman gives when she hears the truth. They were entranced. They started asking questions. By the end of the conversation, the air on that boat was thick enough to chew. The girls were visibly turned on.
Dirk sat there, steering the boat, looking back and forth between me and the girls like he was witnessing a magic trick he couldn’t explain. He couldn't fucking believe it. That afternoon converted him more than any argument ever could.
The Oracle
Finally, there is Vera.
There is a dogma in the Red Pill space that says men and women cannot be friends. That is mostly true—usually, sexual tension or hidden agendas rot the foundation. But Vera is the exception that proves the rule.
We met in Shanghai. She is Indo-Chinese, born in Germany, incredibly beautiful, and wildly successful. We used to laugh at her terrible Chinese accent when she tried to order bread—"Idali mianbao"—but when it came to business, she spoke with perfect fluency.
She acts as an Oracle in my life. She forced me to read Ray Dalio’s Principles, which fundamentally changed how I view systems and decision-making. She holds a standard for me that has nothing to do with desire and everything to do with excellence.
But our friendship wasn't forged just in success; it was tested in failure.
Vera invested in a business deal with me. It didn’t work. Startups are a contact sport, and sometimes you get hit. Not everything works—that is a law of the universe I have detailed throughout this book. You can have the best team and the best vision, and the market can still say no. You have to accept the losses with the same stoicism as the wins.
When money evaporates, masks usually fall off. A lesser person would have torched the bridge. A weaker friend would have let the lost capital poison the water.
Vera didn't.
Does she still grill me for it? Absolutely. She never lets me forget it. She holds my feet to the fire, not out of malice, but out of a high-performance demand for accountability. She reminds me that even a Dominus can miss the target.
But she remains one of my closest friends. Why? Because she understands the game. She knows that risk is the price of entry for the life we live. She knows that if you aren't breaking things occasionally, you aren't moving fast enough.
She proves that a Dominus can value a woman for her mind, her spirit, and her resilience, provided the boundaries are absolute. She is recently married, and I am happy for her. She is the female peer who reminds me that while I lead the women in my house, I must still listen to the women who have built their own.
Weaponized Friendship
So, how do you build this? You don't find it; you forge it.
Men bond through Shared Hardship and Shared Mission. We do not bond face-to-face talking about our feelings; we bond shoulder-to-shoulder looking at a problem. This is why I bring men into the physical domain. Come to the gym. Come to the cold plunge.
If I meet a potential business partner or a new friend, I put them through the ringer. I want to see how they handle discomfort. Do they quit? Do they complain? Do they cheat the reps when I'm not looking? The gym is a lie detector. If a man cannot keep a promise to his own body, he will not keep a promise to your business.
I also bond through The Deal.
There is a stigma that you shouldn't mix friendship and business. I disagree. I think you must mix them, provided you have the right men. My closest brothers are the ones I am making money with. Why? Because we are in the trenches together. We are sharing risk. We are hunting the same mammoth.
The Council of Men
You need a formal structure. You cannot rely on "hanging out."
I recommend establishing a Council. A small group of 3-5 men. You meet quarterly. In person if possible, or on a serious call if not. The agenda is not gossip. The agenda is The Audit.
We go around the table. We review the pillars:
            * Health: Are you fat? Are you training?
            * Wealth: What are the numbers? Where is the exposure?
            * Woman: Is your house in order? Is she adding value or drama?
            * Mind: Are you sharp or are you drifting?
It is brutal. It is necessary.
I had a session where a friend told me, flat out: "You are distracted. You are chasing shiny objects and ignoring the main thing." I wanted to defend myself. I wanted to argue. But I looked at him—a man I respected, a man who had bled—and I shut up. I listened. He was right. That conversation saved me six months of wasted time.
That is the value of the Phalanx. It protects you from your own blind spots.
The Synthesis
This is the Phalanx. It is not a monolith. It is a collection of specific energies.
            * The Brother (Ryan) reminds me to compete.
            * The Redemption (Craig D) reminds me to forgive.
            * The Disruptor (Craig C) reminds me to fight.
            * The Mirror (Clinton) reminds me to connect.
            * The Challenger (Dirk) reminds me to behave.
            * The Oracle (Vera) reminds me to listen.
            * The Loyal Paradox (Victor) reminds me to grind.
            * The Anchor (Monty) reminds me of where I came from.
A man who stands alone is fragile. A man who stands in the center of this circle is unbreakable. Build your council. Audit it ruthlessly. Love them fiercely. And never, ever let them let you slide.
Chapter 11: The Shadow and the Saboteur
There is a voice that wakes up with you when you have won too much, too fast. It is not the voice of the critic, nor the voice of the enemy. It is the voice of the Imposter.
I stood on the main stage at a superclub, arms outstretched, sweat dripping, blinding lights washing over three thousand people screaming my name. To them, I was a god. I was the shaman controlling their pulse, their dopamine, their night. Inside, I was laughing. A cold, hollow laugh that echoed in the space between the bassline and my ribcage.
All I’m doing is pressing a fucking button.
I looked at the crowd, and I didn’t feel pride. I felt like I was getting away with a heist. I felt like a fraud.
This is the Shadow. And if you are a high-performing man, you know exactly what I am talking about. It is the quiet, corrosive guilt of the talented. The feeling that because it came easy to you, because you didn’t bleed for every inch, you don’t deserve the ground you stand on.
I’ve carried this my whole life. From the outside, people look at me—the millions, the properties, the six-pack, the women, the influence—and they see a King. They see the top 0.01%. But from the inside, for years, I saw a guy who was just "blagging it."
It started with Dedipower. We told the world we were a high-security enterprise infrastructure facility. We told clients they couldn’t visit the data centre for "security reasons." The security reason was that we were three boys above a tyre shop in Reading. We had illegal cables running through a trench we dug ourselves. We had health and safety violations that would have shut us down in an hour. We were terrified that one day, a grown-up would walk in, tap us on the shoulder, and say, "Alright lads, the game is up."
But the tap never came. The money did. The exit did. And instead of feeling like a genius, part of me felt like a con artist.
The Shadow grew largest when the lights were brightest. It was the music that nearly broke my sense of self. See, the narrative in my head wasn't fair. I wasn't talentless. In the beginning, I was a pioneer. I had a home studio before it was cool. I was making mashups and edits that tore roofs off clubs before the rest of the industry caught up. I was the first and only UK DJ signed to the infamous Crooklyn Clan website, rubbing shoulders with legends like DJ Riz and Fatman Scoop. I earned that. I had the ear. I had the rhythm.
I climbed the ladder until I was the Music Director for M1NT Shanghai—the most famous, hedonistic, high-voltage nightclub in China. I ruled that room. But then came the next level. The "Superstar DJ" level.
I had releases on Spinnin' Records and Revealed. I had Hardwell and Tiësto playing my music to crowds of fifty thousand people. My name was on the flyers. My face was on the billboards. But here is the confession: I wasn't making the music anymore.
I was sitting in studios with engineers. I was paying the best producers in the game to craft the sounds. I was directing, yes. I was saying "change that kick," or "lift that breakdown." But I wasn't the one sweating over the mouse and keyboard until 4 a.m. I was outsourcing the magic.
It felt soulless. I would stand there while a crowd lost their minds to a track "I produced," knowing that a kid in a bedroom in Holland had done the heavy lifting while I wrote the cheque. I felt fake. I felt like I had bought my way into the Hall of Fame. And because I felt like a fraud, I self-sabotaged. I didn't fully own the victory. I kept waiting to be exposed. I treated my success like something I had stolen, rather than something I had built.
It took me a long time to realise that this feeling wasn't just my own dysfunction. It was an inheritance.
My father was a genius. A legitimate expert in digital marketing before the internet even really existed. He worked at DIGITAL when they launched AltaVista—one of the very first search engines, long before Google ate the world. He was in the room when the future was being written. People looked at him like an oracle. They hung on his every word.
But he used to tell me something that stuck in my ribs like a knife. People would ask him what he wanted to do in life, and he would laugh and say, "I still don't know." He would tell me privately that he couldn't believe people listened to him. "I'm just making things up on the spot," he’d say. He truly believed he was winging it.
But looking back now, I see the truth he couldn't see. He wasn't "making it up." He was channeling. His brain was so fast, his experience so deep, and his intuition so calibrated that the answers appeared instantly. To him, it felt like guessing. To everyone else, it looked like magic.
It is the same for me. I realised that what I called "The DJ Sham" was actually Executive Function.
I wasn't the imposter. I was the Producer.
Do you think Steve Jobs soldered the chips inside the iPhone? Do you think Elon Musk screws the bolts onto the rockets? No. They hold the Vision. They hold the Capital. They hold the Leverage.
I had made it to that stage not because I was the best sound engineer, but because I was excelling at the game of life more than everyone else. I was using "unknown knowledge"—networks, financial might, influence, taste, and sheer audacity—to create a product that the world wanted. I brought the engineer the platform. I brought the track to the label. I brought the sound to the club. Without me, that music stays on a hard drive. With me, it became an anthem.
I wasn't faking it. I was Orchestrating it.
But before I understood that, the Shadow demanded a price. And it usually demanded it in cash. When you secretly believe you don't deserve your success, you unconsciously try to get rid of the reward. You bleed money. I call this The Guilt Tax.
I am a generous man. I don't apologize for that. When my staff in Indonesia lost their homes to floods, I paid to rehome them. I still pay my Ayi in China every month, five years after I left, because she looks after Kaikai—my dog that I haven't seen in years but still love deeply. That is Noble Generosity. That comes from strength.
But there is a dark side. There is Sabotage Generosity. I used to hemorrhage money in four specific ways, all driven by the Shadow, all designed to punish myself for winning too easily.
First, I paid Ex-Girlfriend Reparations. I would give money to women I had broken up with. Not because I owed them, but because I felt guilty for "wasting their time." I felt like I had damaged their lives by not marrying them. I was paying a fine for my own freedom. It was weakness dressed up as charity.
Second, I suffered from the Robin Hood Complex. I paid for everything. Dinners, holidays, drinks. Hangers-on and "friends" would sit at the table and wait for the bill to slide to me. My mother hated it. I remember one dinner where a girlfriend ordered the most expensive item on the menu without blinking. My mum called her out on the spot. It was funny, but it cut deep. She saw what I refused to see: I wasn't being generous. I was buying permission to exist.
Third, I fell into the Convenience Trap. This one killed businesses. After Dedipower, I had money, so I stopped grinding. I tried to pay for convenience. I hired people to do the hard work I should have been doing myself. But startups do not run on invoices; they run on hunger. You cannot outsource the struggle. By paying to skip the hard times, I robbed those new ventures of the grit they needed to survive.
Fourth, I engaged in Deal Sabotage. I would sign contracts without proper due diligence. I’d be sloppy with terms. Deep down, a voice was whispering: "If this goes wrong, I deserve it." That is the Shadow. It wants you to lose because losing feels more "honest" than winning easily.
Most men don't realise they are running this program until the bank account is empty or the relationship is dead. The Shadow disguises itself. It manifests in the "Good Times Fight"—picking an argument when everything is peaceful, because peace feels suspicious to a nervous system addicted to the struggle. It shows up in the "Victory Spend"—closing a massive deal and immediately blowing the cash, not as a reward, but as a purge. You are unconsciously trying to get back to "zero" because the hunger of the climb feels safer than the responsibility of the summit.
Getting rid of this Shadow is absolute IMPERATIVE to breaking out into the next level of existence. You cannot scale a dynasty if you secretly believe you shouldn't be the King. You cannot lead a tribe if you are waiting for someone to tell you to step down.
However, the Shadow still needs to be fed. You cannot simply think your way out of this guilt. You have to pay for it.
I realised that my Imposter Syndrome came from a lack of physical cost. I was winning with my mind and my money, but my body was too comfortable.
So, I found the cure. It wasn’t therapy. It was Penance.
I realised why I fast for forty hours. I realised why I train until I feel sick. I realised why I step into freezing water every single morning.
I am not just doing it for health. I am doing it to pay the tax.
I feel like I have "underperformed" in life because my talent and my leverage carried me. So now, I force myself to suffer physically to earn the right to succeed financially. I act like a heretic. I whip the body to silence the mind.
When I am hungry, when I am cold, when I am lifting heavy iron, I cannot say I am faking it. The pain is real. The discipline is real. And that pain validates the success.
Writing this book was the final exorcism of that Shadow. You cannot write two hundred pages of law, philosophy, and strategy if you are empty. You cannot articulate a Code if you do not have one. Putting these words on paper forced me to look at the "stack" of my life—the businesses, the failures, the women, the systems—and admit the undeniable truth: I know what I am doing.
The things I was "making up on the spot"? That was genius disguised as improvisation. That was the accumulated data of a lifetime of risk, processed in a millisecond.
The Shadow tries to keep you small. It tells you that if you didn't suffer for it, it isn't yours. It tells you that your ease is evidence of your fraudulence. It is a lie.
If you feel like a fraud because you are winning, good. It means you have a conscience. But do not let it destroy you.
Someone told me once: "You only need to be one page ahead in the manual to be an expert."
That’s it. You don’t need to be a wizard. You just need to be the guy who read the page the others didn’t.
Your Imposter Syndrome is vanity disguised as modesty. It is you obsessing over your feelings instead of the result you provide to the tribe.
You are the King. You are the Boss. You are the Axis.
You have to amplify your self-vision until it matches the reality of what you have built. You have to look in the mirror and say, "Yes, I am the 0.01%. And I am going to act like it."
Not out of arrogance. Out of duty.
If you feel the Shadow creeping in—the urge to sabotage, the voice that says you’re a fake—don’t argue with it. Go get cold. Go get hungry. Pay the tax in the gym. Then put the crown back on your head, walk out the door, and lead. Because you aren't blagging it anymore. You wrote the manual.
Generational wealth is a myth if it isn’t backed by generational law. Look at the statistics: seventy percent of wealthy families lose their fortune by the second generation, and ninety percent lose it by the third. It’s the Cornelius Vanderbilt curse—one man builds the empire, the next manages it, and the third spends it on parties until the name on the building is the only thing left. Why? Because the grandfather conquered the mountain, the father enjoyed the view, and the son had no idea gravity existed.
I refuse to let my bloodline rot in silk. Money without discipline isn’t a gift; it’s a curse. It acts as an amplifier for character—if you are disciplined, money makes you dangerous; if you are soft, money makes you dead. It turns potential into hedonism and hunger into addiction. If I hand my children millions without handing them the "Shadow"—the knowledge of the traps, the guilt, and the discipline required to carry it—I am not setting them up for life. I am funding their suicide.
This is why the Code must be installed early. Before the money hits their accounts, the wisdom must hit their bones. They need to know that their father felt like an imposter, so when they feel it—and they will—they don't sabotage the empire just to feel "real." I am passing down the map of the minefield so they don’t have to step on the same explosives I did.
The goal is not just to maintain the dynasty, but to evolve it. Each generation must stand on the shoulders of the last, not to rest, but to reach higher. They must know the cost of the crown so they never apologize for wearing it. I am not just leaving them a trust fund; I am leaving them a manual on how to survive it.








Chapter 12: Energy, Vices & Discipline
I told you I needed penance. This is the manual for that pain.
You can have the body, the car, the cash, the corner office. If your nervous system is cooked from stimulants and screens, if your dopamine’s fried from porn and scrolling, if every notification yanks your attention like a dog on a lead, you’re not a king. You’re a junkie with status.
The addiction now isn’t heroin or meth. It’s comfort. It’s distraction. It’s chaos packaged as lifestyle. Men chase intensity because they’re scared of stillness. They chase novelty because they’ve got no direction. They confuse overstimulation with ambition. The Dominus doesn’t. He runs a different operating system.
He is calm. Not slow. Calm. Still. Lethal. Tuned like a blade. Because he understands a simple law most men ignore. You cannot lead others if you cannot lead your own energy.
This chapter is that law. Sobriety, not just from substances, but from servitude to impulse. Fasting, not just from food, but from ease. Sex, not as indulgence, but as weapon. Training, not for selfies, for calibration. Ritual. Rhythm. Silence. Hunger. Precision. Master your appetites or your appetites will master you. When a man owns his energy, the room feels it. Women soften differently. Men listen harder. Everything orients.
Not because he is loud. Because he is clean.
Clean energy is gravity. It pulls, it does not beg. Clean energy is contained and non-negotiable. That is what separates the performer from the leader.
You want Dominus in substance, not style. Start here.
The Night I Killed the Noise
No dramatic overdose. No rehab. No tears on a beige sofa. Just another night.
December 30th, 2020. Bali. I went out with four women. Beautiful, enchanted by me or my wallet, take your pick. Bottles, basslines, ego. We stumbled back to my villa at sunrise, high on sex and self-importance. Not coke, I’ve never touched it, didn’t need it. The energy was toxic anyway. Overcooked. The kind of night that tricks you into mistaking stimulation for success.
They fell asleep across the villa like trophies. The silence came after, and in that quiet I felt it. Emptiness. The noise wasn’t out there. It was in me.
I woke up late on the 31st. Mouth like sand, room like a crime scene, half-finished drinks, hairpins in the sink. No parties that New Year’s Eve, thanks COVID, just silence. It hit harder than any hangover. This was it? This was my edge?
I had won the game. Money, women, reputation. I wasn’t sharp. I wasn’t lethal. I wasn’t clean. I was living at eighty percent and pretending it was a hundred.
I walked out to the pool. Heat. Blue sky. Brutal clarity. I made the most important decision of my life. No more alcohol. Not a taper. Not a “thirty days to reset.” A full stop.
Almost five years. Not a drop. No champagne at celebrations. No wine with steak. No tequila shots for bants. Nothing. I didn’t quit because I was broken. I quit because I was bored of playing beneath my ceiling. That half-focused, half-hungover, half-present version of me died in daylight. I buried him without flowers. I never missed him.
Here’s what happened when he was gone. My wealth doubled. My training went savage. My women deepened. My peers listened. When I spoke, people leaned in. Not because I shouted, because the signal was clean. The voltage changed. That’s sobriety’s secret. It isn’t virtue. It’s voltage.
The man who can deny the drink, deny the dopamine, deny the easy exit, doesn’t enter a room. He owns it. Women feel it before they name it. Men do too. Nobody can articulate it, but the body knows. You aren’t erratic. You aren’t split. You aren’t hiding from yourself. You’re whole, present, dangerous.
Most won’t get that story. They’ll call it dramatic. Fine. The ones who’ve hit their ceiling and still wanted more, they know. Power doesn’t come from indulgence. It comes from control. Discipline doesn’t cage you. It frees you. In a world drunk on stimulus, the man who chooses clarity is untouchable.
You don’t need a lab coat to feel the difference, but if you want reasons, here you go. Stop drinking and your liver stops fighting you. Hormones rebalance. Testosterone climbs. Fat drops. Your heart rate stabilises. Blood pressure slides down. Inflammation cools. Your gut, which is basically your second brain, stops getting acid washed. Skin clears. Mood steadies. Anxiety and that two-day hang-xiety you pretend is quirky? It fades because the baseline stops crashing. Your sleep deepens. You wake up with a nervous system that isn’t begging for rescue at 11 a.m.
Your brain switches back on. Processing speed. Memory. Decision-making. Dopamine sensitivity resets. Confidence becomes earned, not poured.
But forget the science for a second. The practical bit is this. You stop apologising for how you feel. You stop negotiating with yourself. You stop being the guy who needs coffee to feel alive and wine to feel okay. You start being the guy who’s fine without either.
If you want a neat rule: don’t drink. If you must, make it rare, planned, and boring. I don’t bother. I like being dangerous too much.


Alcohol isn’t the only thief. Men drain themselves through porn, reels, and the constant drip of novelty. Porn rewires desire into spectacle. Reels reduce attention to confetti. Notifications slice your day into fragments. The cost isn’t just time. It is your capacity to feel depth. You become a man who can’t sit still for twenty minutes. If you can’t sit still, you can’t lead.
I run simple laws. Porn is out. If you need a rule, sixty days cold turkey. Most men realise it wasn’t about sex at all. It was about sedation. Phones get rules too. No phone in the bedroom. No notifications. If someone needs me urgently, they call twice. Everything else can wait. Social media gets a publishing window. Twenty minutes in, publish, respond, out. No doom scroll. You think you’re gathering intel. You’re collecting insecurity.
If you need the hit, swap it. Five minutes of box breathing. Ten minutes of sun on your face. Fifty kettlebell swings. A shower so cold you swear at the tiles. The body resets faster than your story does.


Most men use sex as sedation. They chase novelty to feel alive. They flood their brain with spikes, then wonder why devotion feels boring. Sex should be conscious. A choice. Not a reflex. I don’t do semen-retention theatre, but I do treat energy like cash. If I give it, there’s a reason. I’m building something with it. If you’re drained and drifting, pull back. You’ll be shocked how fast clarity returns when you stop turning your nervous system into a carnival.
Discipline isn’t only about not doing. It is also about doing what most won’t touch.
Shanghai, peak chaos. I hired a tutor named Charlie. She walked into my flat at 10 a.m. daily. Curtains open. “Class time.” I hated her for it and I loved her for it. Tones. Characters. Drills. On some days I could barely last twenty minutes before my brain fogged. I sometimes used modafinil to get through long blocks. It sharpened me, but what really changed me was the ritual. Every day, at a fixed time, I did the hard thing until it was easier.
Mandarin became a quiet blade. In M1NT I’d let two girls assume I couldn’t understand, then answer them cleanly in Mandarin. The look they gave me wasn’t just attraction. It was respect. The room shifted. Yes, it was a flex, and yes, it felt good, but it was more than that. It changed me. Language builds neural pathways. You become better at noticing, regulating, deciding. You become a man who expects himself to learn, who isn’t scared of being bad for a while.
And that expectation bleeds into everything else. You stop thinking effort is pain. You start treating effort like pride.
The Gym Is The First Law
If you’re not training, you’re decaying. End of. I don’t care how many zeros you’ve got. If your body is soft, your word is soft. People won’t say it to your face. They feel it in their bones.
The gym is not about aesthetics. It is visible self-governance. It tells the world, and your own nervous system, that you enforce standards. You think clearer when you train. You decide faster. Testosterone rises. Anxiety falls. Your walk changes. You take up the space that is yours and no more. You become a transmitter of rhythm. Even if all you’re doing is walking into a boardroom, your body communicates certainty before your mouth opens.
I’ve always been physical. Football, sprinting, contact. In my twenties I was athletic and unrefined. The DJ years? Drinking, flights, random calories, sleep that looked like a ransom note. I look at those photos and see a man I would not follow. That’s a harsh sentence. It’s honest. Bali snapped me straight. I saw a pool photo and felt embarrassed, not because I was fat, because I was undisciplined. That was the day I decided my body had to reflect my law.
Now I train five days minimum. Heavy lifts. Sprints. Carries. I track macros. I eat protein like I’m feeding wolves. I fast when useful. Hydrate first. Supplement like an adult, not a brochure. Creatine, fish oil, multi, magnesium, collagen. No magic. Just consistency. The session is the first block in the calendar. If I haven’t trained, I’m not calibrated. If I’m not calibrated, I’m not fit to lead.
When I have children, I want them to see it. Not stories about Dad’s glory days. Mornings where Dad trained while everyone slept. My sons will learn what discipline looks like before they learn algebra. My daughters will know the shape of a man who treats his body like a throne, not a dustbin.


Discipline has to be installed. Not talked about. Installed. You build an environment that drags you toward the man you say you are. My villa is a temple to discomfort. Dry sauna. Cold plunge. Hot tub. Steps between them. No excuses.
The cold plunge every dawn is non-negotiable. Four degrees. Breath catches, mind panics, body wants to run. I stay. That is not masochism. That is a daily reminder of who is in charge. The cold strips away noise like an acid wash. For hours after, focus hums. Dopamine and noradrenaline spike in a way that coffee can only dream of. If science helps you comply, good. I don’t need it. I feel it.
Ritual didn’t stay solo. I brought it into my relationships because discipline is contagious and because shared hardship bonds deeper than shared pleasure.
Alice was the first. Australian Chinese. Brilliant. Fire in heels. We met at Ultra in Croatia, screamed lyrics under stars, all that madness. We reconnected in Bali. One dawn she watched me get in the cold. Towel round her shoulders, eyebrows up. “Come in,” I said. She hesitated. I stepped back in, took her hand, guided her breath. The water hit and she panicked. Shallow breathing. Teeth at war with themselves. She bailed after ten seconds. Then she went back in. Next day, fifteen. Then thirty. A week later she did two minutes and cried on the way out. Not from pain. Release. The ritual etched something. She wasn’t just in my bed anymore. She was inside my system. That is the moment women start to devote. Not because you demanded. Because the structure transformed them.
Naomi was already devoted, the ice took us deeper. We sat hand in hand and breathed through the bite. When we stepped out she put her head on my chest and sobbed, calm tears, that quiet shaking that says a body finally feels safe. Not safe like comfort. Safe like, I can let go because he will not. That stays longer than any dinner or any orgasm.
Every woman aligned to my House learns the ritual. Not a party trick. A ceremony. The cold baptises trust. The sauna warms it. The hot tub finishes it. Afterwards they look at me differently. Not just desire. Reverence. Not worship of me. Respect for the law. I represent the law. That is the point.
Most men think pleasure is about taking. They are wrong. Pleasure done right is structure. Give her a container that holds while she shakes, while she breaks, while she becomes. That imprint will outlast your car. It will outlast your jawline. It becomes memory in the body. She won’t be able to explain why she trusts you in a storm. She’ll just trust you.
The Protocols
You want frameworks. Here.
Alcohol. Zero. If you refuse zero, pick six events a year and drink like an adult, two glasses, home by midnight, hydrate, sleep. If you can’t keep it that clean, go back to zero.
Porn. Sixty days off. Delete accounts. Use blockers. If you’re failing at day four, you don’t need motivation, you need friction. Move the device. Sleep phone-free. Replace the urge with pushups, breath, walk.
Phone. Flight mode until after training. No phone in the bedroom. No banners. No badges. Calls twice for urgent. Social publish window once or twice a day, twenty minutes max. If you need your phone for work early, whitelist three contacts, nothing else.
Food. Protein every meal. Track for thirty days to learn your eyes. Whole food default. Eat slow. Cut the beige sugar-crack. One free meal a week if you’re lean, none if you’re not. Hydrate before coffee. Salt your water if you train hot.
Fasting. Once a week. Starting 5pm Saturday, finishing 9am Monday. It’s brutally difficult, but it gives you mastery over instinct. Proof you are in control. And the health benefits are well documented.
Training. Five sessions. Two heavy lifts, one athletic, one conditioning, one optional pump or sport. Walk daily. If travel crushes you, do hotel room circuits. If you tell me there’s no time, I’ll show you a calendar full of people you’re trying to impress.
Sleep. In bed same time. Morning light in your eyes early. Dark room. Cool room. No late caffeine. Magnesium before bed. If you work late sometimes, fine, but protect the average.
Work Blocks. Three ninety-minute deep blocks a day is elite. Anything more is theatre. Protect them like gold. Put meetings in the afternoon. Publish and reply after work blocks.
Cold. Three to five minutes cold three to five days per week. Sauna as bookend if you’ve got it. If you don’t, cold shower. Stop being precious.
Sex. Intention. If you are leaking energy and losing discipline, pause. If you are clean and leading, proceed. Bring ritual into it. Eyes. Breath. No phone within sight of the bed. You’re not a student.
Stimulants. One coffee late morning. None after 2 p.m. Cut for a week every two months to re-sensitise. No secret cans. No daily pre-workout dependency. If you need fireworks to lift, you’re under-slept.
Dopamine. Pick three daily wins that are process, not outcome. Train. Deep work. Sun. When the urge to scroll hits, walk outside. If you can’t go outside, hang from a bar for thirty seconds. Sound silly. Works.
Run this for thirty days and your life will feel like a different house with the same furniture.


Something strange happens when you get clean. Rooms settle when you walk in. You don’t fidget. You don’t over-laugh. You don’t run hot then go missing for two days. You become predictable in the best way. Predictable like a sunrise. People trust that. Women relax into it. Men orient around it.
If you think alcohol gives you confidence, what it actually gives you is temporary fearlessness and permanent forgettability. Sober men remember and get remembered. You think sobriety is boring. It is the opposite. It gives you drama you can actually use.
I’m not asking you to become a cold statue. That’s weakness in a different coat. Discipline isn’t rejection for rejection’s sake. It is selection. It is saying yes to the things that build your line and no to the things that don’t. It’s controlled fire, not a fire ban.
I still laugh, I still love, I still take my women away and forget the phone for forty-eight hours. The difference is I’m choosing. I am not getting dragged by my appetites like a man being pulled down a road by a dog he bought to impress someone else.
After I quit drinking and installed these laws, everything elevated. Not just numbers. Atmosphere. Women stopped orbiting the lifestyle and started orbiting the law. They trained harder. Ate cleaner. Woke earlier. Aligned without being asked. The men shifted too. Messages like, “Wait, you don’t drink?” Then the pause. “Respect.” Because in a culture addicted to numbness, clarity reads like rebellion.
Your energy tells the world how to treat you. If you’re sloppy, you’ll get sloppy. If you’re clean, your life starts to behave.
The edge you avoid becomes the weakness that ruins you. If you don’t train your nervous system, the world will. It will do it with deadlines, with conflict, with betrayal, with babies that won’t sleep, with markets you can’t control. If your baseline is clean, you remain the axis while it spins. If your baseline is chaos, you spin with it.
This is the law. Own your energy. Kill the noise. Build the rituals that bite back. Lead yourself until your presence does the talking. Then watch what happens. Women soften. Men align. Money listens. Rooms calm. Not because you learned a trick. Because you became the kind of man who doesn’t need one.
Build it like it matters. Because it does.


Chapter 13: Chaos Proves the King
Chaos isn’t the enemy. It is the test. Every man who dares to lead will face it, and the sharpest version often arrives through the women in his life. They test you, sometimes on purpose, often on instinct. Not to break you. To feel you. To find out if you are the mountain you keep saying you are. When the storm is hers, your job is simple. Stay unmoved. If you crumble, she will feel it. If she feels it, she will lead. Not because she wants to, but because she has to.
My hardest test came with Anna. Belarusian. Ridiculous beauty. Spine of steel. She could stop time just by walking into a room. The kind of woman billionaires try to buy. She liked to remind me she could be paid like the wives of the ultra rich, but she would not tolerate that life for long. She did not want to be bought. She wanted to be moved.
She chose me. Not blindly. She aligned with almost all of my vision. The mission. The tempo. The edge. She saw a house becoming a dynasty and wanted to serve the structure, not as a slave, as a woman with pride. She even tried to step into my world of multiple women. We had a threesome. She wanted to be enough. I mistook desire for readiness and I rushed it.
That was on me. I thought devotion would outrun biology. I thought willpower would override timing. It didn’t. The crack didn’t show up as drama. It showed up as a tremor in the frame. Quiet. Deep. You learn quickly that chaos does not always shout. Sometimes it simmers and waits for you to ignore it. I pushed too soon and the foundation shook. Not because the vision was wrong. Because the leadership was loose.
What did she actually need? Certainty. A container. The feeling that her chaos could smash into me and nothing would move. Instead of a mountain she got an architect who had not fully stress tested the frame.
That is what chaos does. It shows you where your structure is still soft. Where your edge is cosmetic. Where you have vision but not pace. A man who cannot hold chaos cannot hold a dynasty. A king who cannot hold his queen in her storm will watch the walls fall from the inside.
We spent months trying to find the line again. I was in Africa building Bitcoin infrastructure, dust and diesel in the air, getting a site online. She was in Russia, following her own path. The distance did not kill the devotion. I remember a message that landed hard. I have missed you. I have not seen you for so long, and I am waiting and waiting. I felt it. I wanted her with me. Not as a fantasy. As a fact in the life I was shaping.
The boy I used to be would have folded. He would have chased, begged, promised, tried to out-romance biology. He would have called surrender love and paid for it later with resentment. I am not that boy.
From the outside, letting her go looked insane. She offered a middle ground. She offered the safe life. We could have married, had children, shot the photos, smiled for the neighbours. That is not my path. I do not build kingdoms on compromise.
I held the line. I told her I wanted her to be fulfilled and peaceful. I would support her. I cannot become someone else or lie about the life I am building. This is not a phase. It is my law.
She nodded. Tears. She asked if we could be friends. We ended as friends who still loved each other. That part is true. It also does not change the rule. Real love does not ask you to delete your mission.
A weak man fails this test. He mistakes bending for intimacy. He begs. He shape shifts. He gets a few more months of calm and loses respect forever. Women do not test men to see them bend. They test to see if the man is real. If he cannot hold when her storm hits, he was never leading. He was performing.
When a woman tests you, through an ultimatum, a withdrawal, a boundary push, she is not trying to wreck you. She is trying to find your spine. Will you fold. Will you break. Will you disappear into her feelings. If you do, she either leaves, or worse, she steps into the vacuum and starts leading for both of you. That job exhausts her. She resents you. She cannot rest.
What does leadership look like in that pressure. Calm. Not cold. Clear. Not cruel. You stay still. You hold the frame. You lead the rhythm again when the thunder passes. No big speeches. Just law in motion.
Picture a man early in his build. He is working long blocks. The woman he is seeing starts to pull back. She wants him to chase. She wants proof that he will pick her over the vision. A soft man abandons the build to win the day. He loses the year. A Dominus says I see you and I care. I am building something bigger than today. I need you to trust me. If you cannot, I understand. I am not stopping. That is not cold. That is clarity. If she is meant to be there, she returns with more respect. If she walks, she was never going to rest in the law anyway.
Chaos also arrives dressed as opportunity. A shiny deal that bends your ethics by two degrees. A partnership that flatters your ego and wastes eighteen months. A city that offers attention but taxes your soul. The test is always the same. Are you the axis or the leaf.
Not every woman will walk this path. Anna could not. That is fine. The ones who can, like Naomi, do not just orbit. They help forge the dynasty. This same pattern shows up in builders at the top. When the pressure hits, the real ones hold. When the market screams for short term, they keep the line. That stillness is not a personality trait. It is a crown. Only a few wear it right.
Storms will keep coming. If you want to lead, you have to treat them like sparring, not like apocalypse. Here is how I run it when chaos hits.
Stay still. Do not react. Do not explain. Do not try to out-argue a hurricane. Presence beats performance. Silence has weight.
Hold the frame. Your frame is your truth and your pace. Do not bend it to match a mood. If she pushes, let her push. If she says she will go, let her go. The frame is not hostile. It is firm.
Lead with clarity. When the weather clears, you move. You train. You build. You make the call that was always next. No drama. Rhythm is leadership in practice.
Train your response. You cannot learn stillness in the middle of a fight. You build it daily. Cold water. Breath. Fasting. Heavy carries. Sitting with discomfort until your nervous system stops throwing toys out of the pram. If you cannot hold the cold for three minutes you will not hold her fire for three hours.
Anna’s line was not a relationship blip. It was a crucible. It burned away the fluff in me. It forced a choice about identity, not just romance. It reminded me that the feminine tests the masculine the same way the market tests a strategy. Not to humiliate. To verify. To see if there is anything under the talk.
Every time you pass, you do more than win the moment. You reinforce the walls of your house. The women who are meant to stay feel safer. The men around you get steadier. The children you will raise inherit a model that works when it rains.


I do not care how poetic your ideas are. If you cannot execute under load, you are not ready to lead. Use these.
The breath rule. When hit, shut up and breathe for sixty seconds. Four in, four hold, four out, four hold. If you cannot count to four, you are not fit to speak.
The hour rule. Do not make commitments or threats in the hour after impact. No promises. No ultimatums. The only action you take is to stop the bleeding and go train or walk.
The written clarity. After the hour, write the mission in one paragraph. If your reaction conflicts with the mission, bin the reaction.
The minimum viable repair. If you broke trust, name the thing you will do daily for thirty days to fix it. Small. Trackable. No speeches.
The boundary script. Learn one sentence and use it. I will not do that. Here is what I will do. Repeat it calmly as many times as needed.
The exit readiness. If your path demands a hard line, be ready to let it break. You cannot bluff. Everyone can smell a bluff.
The morning law. Storm at night. Law in the morning. Up on time. Train. Work block. Publish. Rhythm over rumination.
Being a mountain is not the same as being a statue. The goal is not to become stone. You can be warm and still. You can hold her while refusing to move your line. You can listen and not agree. The skill is to absorb the storm without absorbing the frame.
Say less. Touch more. If you hug her for two minutes of slow breath you will do more for regulation than talking in circles for two hours. After she calms, give a clear next step. Tonight we rest. Tomorrow breakfast at eight. Then I head to the site. I will message you at twelve. Predictability is love when she is spinning.


Men fold because they are under-slept, over-stimulated, and scared. They fold because they have told small lies for months and big truth has nowhere to stand. They fold because they have not built the daily proof that makes them respect themselves. If you do not respect yourself, you will sell your path for a pat on the head.
Fix the inputs. Sleep like you mean it. Train until your mind goes quiet. Cut the booze. Kill the attention leaks. Publish your mission somewhere that scares you a bit. Now you are hard to move.
When you hold still in a storm, something subtle happens in the room. She breathes deeper even if she is angry. She hates the boundary and trusts the man. Later, when the weather clears, attraction returns with more depth. Not because you won. Because you did not vanish.
If she leaves anyway, you did not lose. You learned your pace and kept it. That pace will pull in the woman who can rest in it. It will also repel the ones who cannot. Good. That is filtration. Filtration is mercy.
Letter to a brother
This is for Mark, and every man who lost himself trying to keep love.
You were the wild one. Athletic, funny, sharp. Rooms tilted when you walked in. Then you fell and started bending. First to avoid drama. Then to avoid loss. Then because bending felt like love. It wasn’t. It was fear in a suit.
You tried the open thing to keep her. You let her sleep with someone else because you thought that offer proved your depth. It killed attraction on the spot. She left anyway. You did not just lose her body. You lost her respect. The part of you that knew better has been screaming ever since.
You rang me and said it out loud. Hypergamy. The thing I told you about. The instinct no speech can outvote. Good. That means the old fire is not dead. It is under ash. Blow on it.
Do not be bitter. Be precise. Get clean. Train. Work blocks. Set one boundary this week and keep it. Let people be upset without fixing it for them. Call your mother. Pay your debts. Publish something that scares you. Take three months and rebuild the frame you should have had before you tried to lead a family.
She did not stop loving you because you failed. She stopped because you stopped leading. Lead again. The right woman will feel it. The wrong woman will complain. Both outcomes help.
Stand up. Do not negotiate with gravity. Build your house like men you respect will live there after you are gone. They will. They are your sons.

Chaos is not personal. It is the weather. Your job is not to ban the rain. Your job is to be a country that handles all four seasons without drama. If you pass this test often enough you stop fearing storms. You start using them. The house tightens. The tribe trusts you deeper. The dynasty hardens.
Stillness in the storm is the crown. Wear it properly.
Chapter 14: The Father Is the Fire
Fatherhood isn’t a lifestyle choice. It’s the final weight. The heaviest crown a man puts on his head and never takes off. You can lead teams, build companies, sleep with beautiful women, turn cities into your playground. Until your child looks up at you with faith instead of need, you haven’t felt the burden of true legacy. That look pins you to your own law. It asks one quiet, brutal question: can I trust you to be the fire that never goes out.
Most people confuse the packaging for the job. Bedtime stories. Birthday cakes. Photos in matching outfits. Nice, sure. None of it is the core. The real work sits underneath where nobody claps. It’s the pressure of being the example. A life so clear and structured your kids calibrate just by being near you. Your daughter studies you to learn what masculine presence feels like in her body. If she senses softness where there should be steel, she will go looking for an edge somewhere else. Your son watches your spine. How you carry pressure. If you collapse, he’ll learn collapse. Boys don’t follow speeches. They copy your standard.
They do not need rage. They do not need volatility. They need the slow, steady fire that lives in the hearth. The kind that lights the compound every morning. The kind women orbit and children trust. The kind that still burns when money goes sideways, when friends vanish, when life tries to bargain you into mediocrity.
Modern men have been told fatherhood is “being there.” Show up. Be soft. Share your feelings. There’s some truth in that, but it isn’t the core. The core is gravity. Stillness. Certainty. Wake up every day knowing your role. Live it. Prove it. Bleed for it. When your child looks at you, they are not asking if you love them. They are asking if they are safe. Safety does not come from softness. It comes from a man who does not flinch.
Here’s the bit that will get people upset. A father is not meant to be seen as the house’s support staff. He’s not a professional dishwasher. He’s not the guy hovering like an emotional sponge, smoothing every bump. A father is a symbol. A flame. A force. He inspires. He builds. He goes to war for a future that echoes after he’s gone. When your children remember you, they won’t talk about lunches you packed. They’ll remember that you never stopped fighting. You stayed sharp. You stayed fit. You stayed alive. Respect is earned by being ever-alive, not ever-present.
Rich or broke, Bali or Barking, a man’s role is to work. To work is to be at war. Not because you’re addicted to grind. Because you understand your life is no longer just yours. Every drop of sweat buys safety and structure for the line that carries your name. You want your children’s respect? Then don’t collapse. Don’t get fat. Don’t go soft. Don’t become the man whose wife runs the home while he pretends to be tired. Don’t make them watch your fire die. Let them see you burn.
I learned half of this by accident. My parents split. Weekdays with Mum. Weekends with Dad. The weeks were discipline and routine. The weekends were action. Sport. Travel. Competition. It wasn’t domestic. It was alive. I didn’t see him mop floors. I saw him sprint. I saw the man who handed me football, tennis, squash, golf. He gave me an engine. That shaped me more than any bedtime story could. It taught me presence beats proximity. It taught me quality beats quantity. It taught me that a boy needs to see a man alive.
If they had stayed together miserable under one roof, I’d have learned collapse, not competition. That’s the honest bit. I’m sad my mum ended up alone, and I’ve told myself I’ll bring her to Dubai and make the last years soft. But the lesson stands. My father wasn’t perfect, but he didn’t quit. That gave me more than any chore list could.
This is how a father earns the right to lead. Not through compliance. Through demonstration. Live a life your children want to honour, not escape. Let them feel the edge. Let them see the fire. When you’re gone they won’t recite your calendar. They’ll talk about the man.
Marriage turns into the beginning of the end for a lot of men. Not because marriage is wrong. Because they settle, then soften. Fire dulls. Mission blurs. They get the ring, the house, the baby, and then they start treating life like something to be managed, not moved. Maybe they still work hard. Maybe they still go gym twice a week. But the algorithm has gone quiet. The primal directive is caged. The body wasn’t built to survive and scroll. It was built to conquer and replicate. To push forward the strength of the line.
To suppress one's innate drive with falsehoods is a slow death. I know this from the trenches. I cheated in previous lives for years, peaking during my wild days in Shanghai.
Cheating is the coward's version of polygyny.
It darkened my soul and corroded my spirit. It is wanting the variety but being too weak to carry the responsibility.
What I do now is infinitely harder. I don't hide the women; I lead them. I don't steal pleasure; I build structure. If you think having two women is just 'fun,' try organizing two women's lives, emotions, and futures without lying to either of them.


One woman can raise a child. One woman cannot carry a dynasty without breaking. You don’t ask one back to do the work of three fronts. You build a House. Multiple women. Devoted. Supported. Lit up. When you step into that openly and lawfully, you don’t drift. You sharpen. You stop sneaking and start leading. You become disciplined because you must be worthy of the orbit you’ve created. The women feel it. They glow. They calm. They surrender into something they actually respect.
A girlfriend told me her friends said she was radiant since she accepted my structure with other women. Not because she was controlled. Because she could rest. She put down the masculine burden of managing everything. She aligned with a man who doesn’t apologise for his nature but channels it like a grown up. That is what draws the feminine. Certainty. Vision. An operating system worth installing.
None of this is about sex points. It’s about blood. It’s about knowing men bled so you could breathe, and you honour them by building. Family. Fortress. Fire.
Not every man will choose this path. Two of my favourite men picked a different one. My brother and my closest friend went early into marriage and fatherhood. Stability. Routine. They didn’t chase attention. They built for family. Their kids are solid. Kind. Grounded. Legacy, full stop. I respect it. Sometimes I envy the timing. They planted young while I was still playing god in nightclubs. They were laying foundation while I was learning the cost of ego. That took courage.
But I’m here now. Awake. Making the plan. I’m not waiting for a perfect moment. I’m moving. They chose devotion through monogamy. I’m choosing scale. Same heart. Different engine. If the blood still burns, build now. Don’t let it fade because somebody told you your window closed.
The Father’s Laws
You want something practical. Here’s what I’ll teach my sons and daughters by what I do, not by what I post.
Law 1: The hearth is sacred. Up before the house. Train. Cold. Breath. Work. When the kids wake, they find you warm and ready, not frantic and late. Presence first, performance next.
Law 2: The body is the throne. If I’m soft, the house is soft. Five sessions a week minimum. I bring the kids to watch sets. My sons learn to spot. My daughters learn to see strength without fear. Saturday morning, family carries in the garden. No phones. Laughter and sweat.
Law 3: The word is iron. If I say I’ll be somewhere, I am there. If I say I’ll be home at eight, I’m home at eight or I’ve messaged at six with a change and a plan. The kids learn reliability in the bones, not from a quote on the wall.
Law 4: The table is court. We eat together. No screens. Eyes up. Everyone speaks. Gratitude. One story, one lesson, one laugh. The table makes a culture.
Law 5: Consequences are clean. No shouting. Clear rules. If you break them, the consequence is immediate and fair. Trust grows when justice is predictable.
Law 6: The mother is honoured. Whether one woman or many, the way I speak to and about the women sets the son’s default and my daughter’s standard. Respect is public. Instruction is private.
Law 7: The mission is visible. My children know what I’m building. I show the maps and the numbers as they age up. They see how decisions get made. They learn law before they inherit assets.
Law 8: Devices kneel. Phones sleep out of bedrooms. Adults too. Tech is a tool. Nobody in this house worships a rectangle.
Law 9: Earn and give. Pocket money is tied to contribution, not existence. Ten percent goes to family projects. They feel the joy of giving and the dignity of earning early.
Law 10: Rite of passage. At twelve, a day with Dad in the mountains or the ocean. Cold, distance, silence, a challenge chosen with them. At sixteen, a bigger trial. A letter I write gets read at the fire. They leave that day different, not because Instagram says so, because they did something hard with their father and won.
The Daughter Standard
My daughter doesn’t need me to be her friend. She needs to live in the presence of a man who can lead without cruelty. I’ll teach her to spot cheap power. I’ll teach her to say no. I’ll make sure she sees women who are strong and soft in my House so she doesn’t mistake chaos for independence. She’ll date with rules. Not prison. Structure. Bring him to dinner. I shake his hand and look at his shoes. We talk goals. I ask him what book he finished this year. If he flinches at questions, he isn’t ready to be questioned by life with her in the car.
The day a boy thinks he can lie to her, he’ll feel the weight of knowing she grew up with a man who didn’t lie to himself. She won’t be perfect. She will not need to be. She’ll know where home is when the world upsets her. The hearth doesn’t move.
The Son Standard
My sons will not earn manhood by accident. We do early mornings together. Chores with pride. They will see me win and fail and see me own it. They will see me apologise with a straight back, not folded shoulders. They will learn that dominance without discipline is a tantrum in a suit. They will run toward hard things. Choose the cold shower every time they want the warm one. Ask hard questions. Lift properly. Speak last. Protect first.
They will also know the truth about our nature. I will not hand them a romantic lie and watch them rot. They’ll understand that men who try to live a double life become hollow. If they want a big family, they will build a container big enough to hold it. If they want one woman, they will lead her properly and never ask her to carry a man’s burden. Either path is honour when it’s owned.
My Father wasn’t an empire builder. He was an honest man who kept showing up. He handed me three grand when I needed servers before I deserved them. Later, when I lost my seat in my own company, he didn’t say I told you so. He helped me find the chairman who helped us scale. He gave me sport and weekends that felt like life. He messed up things too, naturally. We all do. What stuck wasn’t perfection. It was the feeling that my dad didn’t give up. That feeling became my baseline.
I’m harsher, faster, louder than he ever was. I can lead better. He can love better. That’s the balance I am trying to bring into my House. Fire that doesn’t burn the people it’s meant to warm.


They care about your energy. If you’re hungover on Sunday, your son feels it more than your colleagues do. If you’re doom scrolling at midnight, your daughter feels the irritability you pretend isn’t there. If you miss training three days straight, the home gets noisier. You can call that coincidence. Or you can admit the obvious. The father is the tuning fork. Everyone takes the key from him.
So you make disciplines that a child can touch. They see you put your phone in the kitchen drawer at night. They hear the timer beep when you’re coming out of the sauna. They stand on the terrace while you breathe in the cold dawn. They sit in your lap at the table and stir their hot chocolate while you drink your black coffee and plan the day. They stop being shocked by routine. They start loving it.
Maybe you’re reading this and you’ve already cheated, already gone soft, already let the house slide into noise. You can come back from that without turning into a monk. Clean the lies. If you’ve been living two lives, pick one and own the cost. If you’ve been passive, say out loud what the mission is, then live it for ninety days before you ask anyone to believe you. Start small. Wake early. Train. Bring breakfast to the table. Put your phone away at six. Take your son for a walk with no headphones. Ask your daughter to teach you something and shut up while she does. These sound tiny. They build a wall quicker than speeches.
If you want a bigger family for real, have the hard conversation like a man. Tell the truth. Give her a structure so solid it can carry more without anyone breaking. If she cannot walk that path, hold her with respect and let her leave. A man who trades his law for company loses both.
A Day I Want My Kids To Remember
It’s a Tuesday. The compound is quiet before dawn. I’ve already trained and done the cold. The air smells like salt and coffee. The women are moving in their rhythms. One stretches on the terrace. One checks breakfast with the chef. One journals. No one is rushing. The older kids come out in hoodies and bare feet. They do ten minutes of mobility and five minutes of breath. The younger ones draw at the long table. I walk into the central room and everything settles half a notch. We eat together. I ask three questions. What did you learn yesterday. What will you do today. How will you help someone else. They answer. We laugh. They clear their plates. I kiss the women on the forehead.
That’s the future memory I want. Calm. Cadence. Fire without smoke.
I’ve said it already but it matters. My brother and my closest friend chose early marriage and fatherhood. They didn’t need a crowd. They planted. They stayed. They have good kids. I respect it. When I see their family photos, I don’t see a trapped man. I see a man who made vows and kept them. That’s weight. That’s rare. If you took that path, hold it tight. Being a warrior at home is still war.
My path is scale. I carry different weight so the House I’m building can carry many. Not better. Bigger. That’s what my vision and logic demands. If yours demands something else and you live it clean, we are on the same side.
To Future Me, From Now
There will be mornings where I want a pass. Where the bed is warm and the night was late. Where the kids’ noise gets under my skin. Where a woman’s tears tempt me to bend the law. Don’t. Get up. Train. Hold. Lead. Laugh. Write. Build. Your children will not remember the emails you sent. They will remember the sound of your footsteps at 5:30. They will remember the taste of salt after you pulled them from the ocean and told them they were brave. They will remember that when everyone else panicked, you made eggs and made a plan.
Fatherhood isn’t about doing everything. It’s about being the axis that makes everything else make sense. Your kids don’t need a superhero. They need a man who doesn’t lie to himself, who doesn’t negotiate with gravity, who keeps the fire burning so the tribe can sleep. Be that man. Build that house. And when you’re gone, they’ll carry the code without you having to ask.
That’s the point. The father is the fire. Keep it lit.
Chapter 15: The Laws of the Dominus
These aren’t tips. Not lifestyle hacks or Instagram quotes. They’re the laws that built my peace. Paid for in blood, boredom, and humiliation.
Ignore them if you want. Life will enforce them anyway.
________________


I. SELF-MASTERY
Law 1: Discipline Is the Source of Respect
Every man wants devotion. Few earn it.
If you can’t govern your appetites, no woman will trust your direction. Discipline isn’t about aesthetics—it’s about proof. The small promises you keep to yourself are the bricks that build authority. Miss enough, and the walls fall.
Wake when you say. Train when you plan. Speak when it matters. Stop negotiating with your own word.
She doesn’t follow your charm. She follows your rhythm. When your word and your movement sync, she relaxes. When they don’t, she starts managing you—and attraction dies quietly behind her eyes.
________________


Law 2: Stillness Crowns the King
Chaos comes disguised as her emotion, your failure, a power cut, a fight at 2 a.m.—whatever tests your frame that day.
The boy reacts. The man absorbs.
Stillness isn’t laziness. It’s precision. When the storm hits, you become the fixed point everyone else calibrates to.
Your calm isn’t decoration—it’s dominance. The room feels it before it sees you. The kids stop shouting. The woman breathes differently. That’s leadership without volume.
Hold. Don’t rush to fix. Let silence do the work.
________________


Law 3: The Obstacle Is the Path
You don’t grow through comfort. You grow through confrontation, with yourself.
Every failure is data. Every betrayal is tuition. The obstacle isn’t blocking the path. It is the path.
The world trains men by pressure. Boys avoid it. Men walk straight into it and come out forged.
Stop praying for an easy season. Pray for a stronger spine.
________________


II. WOMEN & POLARITY
Law 4: Polarity Is Nature’s Design
She doesn’t want equality. She wants electricity.
When you both play neutral, nothing moves.
Masculine energy leads. Feminine energy flows. That’s not politics, it’s physics.
She doesn’t need you to dominate. She needs you to decide.
When you step forward with clarity, she softens without being told. When you hesitate, she hardens and fills the vacuum.
Stop debating nature. Lead her. Let her exhale.
________________


Law 5: Lead. Don’t Chase.
Stand still and radiate direction. That’s magnetism.
Chasing kills it. Every time you beg for attention, you’re broadcasting lack.
She follows the man who already knows where he’s going. The mountain doesn’t chase the weather, it shapes it.
Lead from motion, not emotion. She’ll feel the difference.
________________


Law 6: Trust Is the Currency of Devotion
You can’t talk your way into trust. You live it, quietly.
She doesn’t believe your speeches. She believes your patterns.
Consistency is the sexiest language a man speaks. The tone, the timing, the way you hold her chaos without flinching.
When she knows your state won’t collapse under pressure, her whole body says thank you.
That’s devotion. Not fireworks, predictability.
________________


III. LEGACY & LEADERSHIP
Law 7: Being Liked Doesn’t Scale
You’re not here to be understood. You’re here to be effective.
Men who chase approval end up leading no one, including themselves.
Decisions that age well rarely sound popular.
A Dominus isn’t elected, he’s recognised. His clarity makes people uncomfortable first, grateful later.
Stop asking if they agree. Start asking if it will matter in fifty years.
________________


Law 8: Build Systems, Not Moments
Fame fades. Systems multiply.
Moments are dopamine. Structures are dynasty.
Every empire I built—works because I stopped chasing highlights and built repeatable laws.
Systems outlive energy. Ritual outlasts emotion.
You don’t scale passion. You scale process.
________________


Law 9: The Father Is the Fire
Kids don’t need your softness. They need your structure.
Be the axis. The spine. The man whose word defines the room.
Fatherhood isn’t babysitting, it’s blueprinting. Your children learn your rhythm before your rules.
They’ll copy your worst habits long before they understand your speeches.
Be the example they calibrate to, not the one they escape from.
________________


Law 10: Vision Outlives Temptation
Temptation whispers now. Vision speaks forever.
Every time you trade principle for pleasure, you dilute your lineage.
A Dominus plays the long game. The night will always moan your name, but kingdoms don’t build themselves.
When you’re tempted, picture your bloodline watching. Then decide.
________________


Law 11: Tribe Beats Family
One man. One woman. One mortgage. One burnout. That model dies every generation and calls it romance.
A tribe endures. Multiple women. Multiple children. One leader. One law.
You’re building a system, not surviving a marriage. Learn to scale.
A dynasty doesn’t depend on one exhausted mother or one anxious son. It runs on shared rhythm and clear hierarchy.
Call it old-fashioned. I call it insurance.
________________


Law 12: Legacy Is Lineage
Your ancestors died for you to exist. The debt doesn’t vanish because Wi-Fi arrived.
You’re not the start of your story. You’re a chapter.
Strengthen the bloodline. Protect the name. Build so well your great-grandchildren feel your discipline in their bones.
Legacy isn’t wealth. It’s weight. Make your surname heavy enough to anchor a future.
________________


IV. THE FOUNDATION
Law 13: The Boy Must Die
Masculinity begins at a funeral.
You bury the boy who craves validation and rise as the man who carries law.
The boy wants to be liked. The man wants to be trusted.
You can’t keep both. Choose.
Burn the softness. Keep the soul.
________________


Law 14: Power Without Integration Is Chaos
Raw energy without aim destroys itself.
Alignment is everything.
Your work, women, and words must point in the same direction—or they’ll cancel each other out.
Talent untrained is a bomb. Integration is how you make it art.
Every choice either reinforces your law or fractures it.
Be one thing, everywhere.
________________


Law 15: Train Your Response Mechanism
The edge you avoid will break you later.
Get cold. Get hungry. Sit in silence. Train discomfort like a muscle.
Your nervous system is your throne room. If it shakes, the kingdom falls.
Hold eye contact longer. Breathe when you want to run.
When the storm hits, the untrained panic. The trained breathe.
________________


These laws aren’t advice. They’re the operating system of a man who refuses to drift.
You don’t quote them. You live them. You don’t memorise them. You embody them. And when you do, you won’t need to explain what a Dominus is. You’ll just walk into a room, and everyone will know.
Chapter 16: The Architect and the War
People ask me where I find the women I surround myself with. They assume I spend my nights in VIP sections, shouting over bad house music, hunting for a model.
I don’t hunt. I cast.
But do not mistake the method for superficiality. I do not cast for aesthetics alone—beauty is common, and often boring. I cast for character.
I am looking for the woman who can hold the gaze of a King without flinching. I am looking for the woman who values order over chaos. I am looking for the woman who understands that submission is not weakness, but a gift of trust given only to the worthy.
I learned this strategy years ago after investing in a brand called Wear Rame alongside a razor-sharp Indonesian girlfriend. I watched closely as she built it. She didn’t just sell clothes; she sold an aesthetic, a vibe, a tribe.
I saw the way high-value women gravitated toward the brand—not because they needed fabric, but because they wanted to be identified with the energy of it. They wanted to be part of the campaign. They wanted to be seen in that world .
That was one of the seeds for AXIS Ethos.
I realised that if you run the brand, you control the ecosystem. You control the standards. You don't have to approach a high-value woman and try to "pick her up." You hire her. You collaborate with her. You invite her into a professional structure where you are already the authority .
Most men try to fish with a single line, standing on the shore, hoping for a bite. By building a brand like AXIS, I built a trawler.
I created a top-of-funnel filter that brings the exact caliber of women I value—aesthetic, feminine, ambitious—right to my door.
But the brand only captures the visual. My job, as the Architect, is to filter for the soul. When a woman steps into the AXIS universe for a shoot or a meeting, the dynamic is already set. I am not the guy buying her a drink; I am the Architect of the world she wants to be part of .
Naomi runs the logistics. Yeye curates the image. But the brand itself? That is the net.
That isn’t pick-up. That’s architecture. Use it for women. Use it for deals. Use it for friends.
If someone steps into your world and sleeps better, breathes slower, makes more, they’ll come back. If they step in and your life is noise wearing cologne, they’ll smile politely and ghost you by lunch .
The Decision Point
Here is the hard truth, though: Most people don’t finish books.
They skim. They highlight a spicy line for Instagram to prove they’re "doing the work." They screenshot a paragraph to send to a mate they haven’t seen in six months, then they go right back to the same habits that are quietly strangling them. They tell themselves they’ve changed because the font was bold and the quote had thunder in it.
They haven’t.
Change doesn’t arrive because you know a thing. It arrives because you choose a thing. And then you keep choosing it when it gets boring, when it gets painful, when no one is clapping.
That’s the bit most men dodge. They consume. They distract. They forget. Then they wake up five years older with the same shoulders, the same bank balance, the same browser history, and the same woman who doesn’t look at them like she did at the beginning.
If you’re still here, you’re not most men. I don’t mean that as a cuddle. I mean your ego has survived two hundred pages of me taking the piss out of your excuses. That’s promising.
So this chapter is for you. Not motivation. Not a pump-up. A decision point. A line you step over and don’t come back from.
By now you know the shape of this life. Masculine certainty. Devoted women. Discipline over dopamine. Business as warfare. Family as dynasty. You’ve watched me cock it up, fix it, cock it up again, then finally shut up and build. You’ve seen where the law bites and where it blesses.
Somewhere inside you, something cracked open. Maybe it was a memory. Maybe it was a quiet fury you’ve been swallowing since a teacher humiliated you at eleven. Maybe it was that simple line from earlier: you cannot lead what you haven’t mastered. You felt it, and your body said yes before your mouth could pretend otherwise.
Good. Because this was never entertainment. This was alignment. And alignment demands action.
Here’s the only question left: do you go back to comfort, or do you begin your war?
Look around. This isn’t a stable culture. You were born into the fall. The empire is rotting in silk. Bread is delivered. Porn is free. Opinions arrive pre-chewed. The men scroll. The women watch. The algorithm turned pretty girls into minor gods and handed them an altar that pays per view. Not because they earned it. Because a billion male micro-surrenders built a throne out of likes. One “hey babe.” One tip. One apology for existing.
There’s no point moaning about it. You won’t code your way out. You won’t argue biology back into the room. The test just changed its clothes. It used to be can you feed me. Now it is can you lead me.
If she doesn’t need your money, and she doesn’t need your roof, she will test your gravity. Hard. You can whine about that, or you can become a mountain.
Most men try to win her like a sales call. They perform sensitivity. They negotiate desire like it is a contract. Every word dries her. Every pitch makes her colder. She isn’t looking for a deal. She’s searching for inevitability. You either carry it or you don’t. There is no Canva template for inevitability.
I learned this the long way, loudly.
Back when Facebook albums were the flex and I still thought fame felt like power, I hunted for sport. I’d land in Vegas, signal the manager, “ten of the hottest Asian girls you’ve got,” and watch gravity do its work. No chase. No pitch. The field bent. Sounds glamorous. At the time it was hilarious. Later it was empty. It taught me something useful, though. When you stop needing, the world moves. When you build presence that isn’t pretending, you don’t ask. You decide. The room follows because it can feel that you’d walk out rather than negotiate reality with anyone.
Men get stuck because they’re trying to be chosen instead of choosing. You think if you were famous enough or shredded enough or rich enough she’d finally see you. I tried that route. Stood at Ultra Miami in 2015, crowd like a living ocean, and Tiësto dropped my track. Hardwell’s label. My name on giant screens. Bass folding the air. I shook. Looked at my mate and thought I’d done it.
Then a cold emptiness slipped in between my ribs.
It wasn’t mine. The stage wasn’t mine. The brand wasn’t mine. The moment wasn’t mine. I had rented a feeling and called it power.
The invoice arrived the next morning.
Real power isn’t rented. It is permanence.
It is structure that breathes when you sleep. It is a system that prints results without asking permission. A family that runs because law is already written in the kitchen. A company that hums because you built the spine before you painted the logo. A villa that pays whether you’re in Bali or stuck arguing in customs.
That’s sovereignty. Not applause. Not likes. Ownership. Rhythm. Law.
You are thinking: That sounds great, Spencer, but how do I actually apply this? I’m not in Miami. I’m in a flat in Birmingham and my girlfriend is annoyed at me.
Simple. You stop negotiating with the world and you start auditing it.
            * What about women? Stop chasing. Start inviting. Refer back to the architecture I spoke about at the start. Create the world, then let them enter it. Speak your reality early without spice. “I lead. I have standards. I don’t apologise for structure. If that scares you, we’re not a fit.” You don’t need to say the word Dominus. You don’t need to say anything theatrical. Be plain. The right ones will move closer. The wrong ones will try to negotiate your backbone into a mood board. Say no and mean it. Then watch your stress drop and your sex improve.
            * What about money? Stop looking for a one-hit miracle. Build systems that move boring things from A to B, then charge for being the man who never lets the line break. A boring business that pays daily is sexier than a scorching brand that feeds your ego and starves your kids. You can layer flair later. Earn the right to be interesting by becoming reliable.
            * What about mates? Audit them like bad debt. Most friends are liabilities disguised as history. Keep the ones who tell you the truth and lift more than they talk. The rest are noise with shoes on. You’re not a hostel. You’re a builder. You can love people without letting them camp in your momentum.
            * What about purpose? You’re not going to find it in a cabin staring at a fern. Purpose is the residue of aligned action. You move clean for six months and your purpose will tap you on the shoulder in the supermarket while you’re buying eggs. “That. Do more of that.” Until then, be too busy to moan about not having one.
This brings us to the trap. The one thing that kills more men than failure ever could.
Potential.
Potential without discipline is a leash you put on yourself.
There’s a particular kind of suffering reserved for men with real potential. Not the pain of losing. The ache of not committing. You can do many things. That makes you dangerous and dull. You win enough to look clever, then you tap out before excellence asks for blood. You tell yourself you’re built for bigger, yet you never define bigger. The result is soft superiority. You feel above the men who picked a lane and suffered in it, while they pass you in silence.
That was me for years. I could sing along with any room. Football, business, music, women. Good enough to win, never forced to go all in. The curse is subtle. You feel clever. You’re actually lazy. Not in hours. In devotion.
This book is my way of cutting that leash. Not another slogan. A vow. I don’t coast. My sons won’t coast. The men who follow this will not mistake talent for power again. Power is when potential becomes proof. When you choose. When you build. When you finish the unsexy middle.
Leadership now isn’t about being liked. It’s about being followed voluntarily. The only way that happens is if your law is strong enough to carry other people without bending to fit their moods. You impose order by existing as order. Tone. Calendar. Food. Bedtime.
That’s where the power hides. You walk into a room and people stop fidgeting with their phones without knowing why. Women feel it first. They won’t say “his nervous system is regulated.” They’ll say “there’s just something about him.” The something is your lack of need.
Men who have built anything real feel it too. They don’t need your charm. They want your clarity. They don’t want quotes. They want a model that works on Monday.
A mate of mine, proper operator, said on the phone, “I’m a leader myself, yeah, but I’d still follow you.” I laughed and told him he’d follow me into a strip club. He laughed harder because he knew the point. It’s not about the club. It’s the energy that says I’m moving and everything worth a damn will reorganise around that motion.
That’s leadership. Even your critics start timing their rants to your schedule.
The One Week Protocol
Here is how you begin. No ceremony. No drum roll. No buying a new notebook that smells like productivity.
The One Week Protocol.
Not a month. One week. You can do anything for seven days that you supposedly want for life.
            1. Wake at the same time every day. No snooze.
            2. Put the phone in another room like an adult with a spine.
            3. Cold water. I don’t care if it is a shower that makes you squeal like a choirboy or a tub full of frozen peas. Get in. Stay in.
            4. Train. Lift things that make your face go interesting shapes.
            5. Eat protein like you’re raising sons. Carbs that come from the ground, not a factory with a cartoon on it.
            6. No alcohol. Not one. Not even “just a glass.” Zero. Show the machine whos driving.
            7. Bed on time. Sex if you’ve earned it and it doesn’t steal your mornings.
            8. Ten pages of a book that isn’t about a wizard.
            9. One hour in deep work with your phone on airplane. Build one brick toward a system that will pay you next year. Not a logo. A process. Ship something small.
            10. Repeat. Seven days.
You’ll want to negotiate by lunchtime on day two. That’s the boy trying to make a deal. He always sounds reasonable. “We can start properly Monday.” “This recipe needs wine.” “It’s my mate’s birthday.”
Fail that voice and you fail the week. Pass that voice and you will feel a small, quiet click in your chest. That’s competence. That’s the seed of authority.
Stop announcing.
Stop saying you’re going to change. Stop doing little performance posts to harvest claps from people who don’t keep promises to themselves. Change in silence. Let your face show it. Let your bank show it. Let your woman’s body show it when she stops testing you for a week straight and gives you that look that says thank you without opening her mouth.
And when you fall, because you will, don’t turn it into theatre. Don’t do a confessional like a YouTuber. Clean the mess. Tighten the law. Get back to the day. The boy loves drama. The man loves rhythm.
You want a dynasty? Good. Then stop treating fatherhood like a vibe and treat it like operations. Kids don’t need empty speeches and cheap words. They need to watch you do as you say, even on dull days. They will eat what you eat. They will speak how you speak. They will either inherit your structure or your excuses. Pick.
You want multiple women? Also good. Then build a house that can hold it without bleeding. Law before lingerie. If jealousy flares, the answer isn’t more cuddles. It is clearer roles, cleaner schedules, and better communication delivered by you in a tone that could hold a bridge. If a woman cannot live your law with grace, bless her and release her. Do not recruit chaos and call it challenge. You are building a choir. Not a mosh pit.
You want respect from men? Earn it by making other men richer, calmer, and stronger when they orbit you. Introduce deals. Share intel. Train together. Eat like adults. Keep secrets. Never brag about things that were meant to stay in the room. The world is full of loud boys who leak. Be the quiet bastard everyone trusts with the keys.
This is the part where a lesser book would give you a rousing speech. You don’t need one. You need a beginning. So here it is. After you close this page, pick one thing and do it now. Not a research spiral. An act.
If you’re at home, clean the kitchen like a surgeon. If you’re with your woman, take her phone, kiss her neck, tell her to run a bath, then set your alarm for 6 a.m. and mean it. If you’re at work, schedule the meeting you’ve avoided and write the agenda in twelve words. If you’re in the gym car park, get inside and lift the weight you’ve been scared of for six months.
Start. The smallest honest act contains more power than your entire notes app.
I’ll finish with something you already know because your bones hummed when you read it back in Chapter 15. You are not here to be liked. You are not here to be tidy. You are not here to apologise for wanting a big, loud, orderly life with love and law in the same room.
You are here to build. To protect. To provide. To fuck with purpose. To raise legends. To leave a system that outlives your teeth.
If that feels heavy, good. Weight builds men. If it feels impossible, you are still negotiating with the boy. Bury him. If it feels exciting, keep it to yourself and let the next six months explain you.
You’ve heard the call. You’ve seen what it takes to lead, to build, to command women without shouting, to inspire men without performing, to father not just children but a pattern that will still be working when your great-granddaughter rolls her eyes at a boy who thinks a playlist is leadership.
No more excuses. No more waiting. No more soft lies about seasons and timing and stars aligning. The world is starving for men who hold the line.
You have the map. You have the code.
Now move.
Chapter 17: The Sovereign Individual
I said move. I meant it literally. You're not a tree. You're not a postcode. You're a mobile asset with a passport and a brain. Act like it.
The map on your wall is a lie, it tells you that you belong to a patch of dirt because you were born there. It tells you that you owe fifty percent of your energy to a government simply because of geography. It tells you that nations are permanent and that your duty is to sink with the ship.
That is Industrial Age thinking. It is dead.
We are living through the single greatest shift in human organization since the Gunpowder Revolution. The authors of The Sovereign Individual saw it coming in 1997. They predicted that the Information Age would destroy the monopoly of the nation-state. They predicted digital money. They predicted the rise of the cognitive elite.
Most people read that book as science fiction. I read it as an instruction manual.
The world is splitting. It is no longer dividing into "East and West" or "Black and White." It is dividing into The Sovereign and The Serf.


I didn’t start out thinking about geopolitics. I started out as a nerd who liked fiddling with hardware.
My background was data centers—Dedipower. I knew servers. I knew cooling. I knew uptime. So when I discovered Bitcoin around 2015, I didn’t see a political statement; I saw a machine.
I was living in China at the time, but I was back in the UK for a few months, doing the things I enjoy—tinkering, building, optimizing. I bought a few ASIC miners and plugged them into my mum’s garage.
If you’ve never heard an ASIC miner, imagine a jet engine trying to take off inside a tin can. My mum lasted about three days before she demanded they be turned off.
I moved them to my dad’s house. Within a week, the hallway felt like a sauna. The heat output was industrial. He told me to kill them or move out. I turned them off.
If I had found a way to cool those machines and keep them running quieter, I’d be closer to a billionaire today. I guess I lacked the conviction, the conviction that writing this book has so eloquently given me.
By 2016, I was already deep in the game in Shanghai. I wasn’t mining Bitcoin anymore; I was mining Ethereum with GPU rigs. And I wasn’t doing it in a garage. I was living in a suite at the Mandarin Oriental.
I realised something simple: The hotel rate was fixed. The electricity was unlimited. The air conditioning was industrial strength.
I set up the rigs in the living room of the suite. I turned the AC to Arctic. I left for the day. When the maid came in to clean, she walked into a room that sounded like a wind tunnel and blinked lights like a spaceship. She didn’t know what she was looking at. She was looking at the future of finance being subsidized by a luxury hotel chain.
The funniest was fucking to the sound of ETH being mined next to the bed by 30+ overheating GPUs. Pure heaven.
That experience taught me the first rule of Sovereignty: Arbitrage.
I used the hotel’s infrastructure to build my asset. I found a loophole in the system and I exploited it to generate yield.
Later, that knowledge of heat, power, and compute became the focus of my business. Now, in Africa, I build real infrastructure—Bitcoin, AI compute. But it started with me realising that I didn’t have to accept the limitations of my environment. I could engineer around them.


This logic applies to nations. In the Industrial Age, you were a serf. The government owned the land, so they owned you. You couldn't leave, so they could tax you as much as they wanted.
In the Information Age, you are a mobile asset. Your capital is digital. Your mind is portable.
This creates a crisis for the old nation-states. Most Western countries—the UK especially—are operating on a dying model. They view their high-net-worth citizens as Milk Cows. They lock the gate, feed you slop, and squeeze you until you are dry to pay for a bloated state that actively despises you.
The Sovereign Individual outlines this perfectly: The government is no longer controlled by its customers (the taxpayers). It is controlled by its employees (the bureaucrats) and its beneficiaries (those who live off the state).
When the employees run the business, costs go up and service goes down. They don’t care about efficiency; they care about their pensions. Democracy in the West has become a mechanism for the majority to vote themselves the money of the minority. It is mathematically doomed.
Then you have places like the UAE.
Dubai is not a farm; it is a hotel. They do not want to milk you; they want to attract you. They treat you like a client. You pay for a visa (subscription), you follow the house rules (law), and in exchange, they provide safety, infrastructure, and zero tax.
If you don't like the service, you can leave. If they don't like your behavior, they can evict you.
It is a pure meritocracy.
It is strange how, as you acquire wealth and responsibility, your politics shift. You stop caring about "having a voice" and you start caring about "getting results." You realise that Authoritarian Meritocracy is infinitely superior to Democratic Chaos.
I don’t want the guy who contributes nothing to have a say in how my tax money is spent. That sounds harsh. It is also true. Why should the passenger grab the steering wheel from the driver?
I moved to Dubai because I am a Sovereign Individual. I am a commodity. My capital, my brain, and my network are mobile. The UK tried to shackle me. Dubai offered me a platform.
Go where you are treated best.


There is a movie called Elysium. Matt Damon plays a worker stuck on a ruined, filthy Earth where the masses live in squalor. Orbiting the planet is a space station called Elysium—pristine, green, advanced, and safe. The elites live there. They have Med-Beds that cure cancer in seconds. They have order.
The movie frames the elites as the villains. Specifically, the Defense Secretary. She is cold. She is ruthless. She shoots down ships trying to break into Elysium.
The audience is supposed to hate her. I watched it and thought: She is the only person doing her job.
She is the Realist. She understands that if you let the entire population of Earth onto Elysium, Elysium ceases to exist. It becomes just another slum. The resources would collapse. The order would vanish.
She is protecting the seed corn.
But the movie ends the way all Utopian fantasies end. They "hack the system," make everyone a citizen, and send the Med-Beds down to Earth. The credits roll with happy music.
But what happens five years after the credits? The resources run out. The Med-Beds break because no one maintains them. The population explodes. Elysium falls. Everyone starves.
This is the hard truth of the future. We are moving toward a world of Elysiums. Gated communities. Private cities. Network states.
The masses will align by geography and race. They will fight over scraps in failing nations. The Sovereign Individuals will align by Ideology and Merit.
I don’t care what color your skin is. I don’t care where your passport is from. I care if you are competent. I care if you adhere to the Code. I care if you add voltage to the network.


We are running out of time to make the jump. AI is coming. And AI is not a great equalizer; it is a great lever. If you have capital and leverage, AI makes you a god. If you are labor, AI makes you obsolete.
The gap between the "Haves" and the "Have-Nots" is about to become a canyon. The middle class is dissolving. You will either own the robots, or you will compete with them. And you cannot beat a machine that doesn't sleep.
This is why I push you to be hard. This is why I preach discipline. This is why I talk about building a dynasty. I am trying to get you on the shuttle to Elysium before the doors close.
Being a Sovereign Individual is no longer a luxury. It is a survival strategy.
            1. Disconnect from the failing nation-states that view you as a resource to be consumed.
            2. Acquire assets (Bitcoin) that cannot be inflated away or seized. Bitcoin is the only property right that relies on math, not a government promise.
            3. Build skills that scale with technology.
            4. Move to jurisdictions that respect capital and order.
The era of the "citizen" is over. The era of the Sovereign has begun.
Get your house in order, because the shuttle is leaving.
Epilogue: Legacy in Motion
The house has a frequency. You feel it before you even see it.
Sandalwood in the air. Pool lights rippling against raw concrete. My daughter is laughing in the kitchen; my son is training by the fire pit. No chaos, just function. Everything has a place. Everyone has a purpose. It’s not a dream. It’s design.
The Dominus Code stopped being a concept the day it became a schedule. The moment every person in this house started waking up to the same law—one written, one lived.
Naomi is on the sofa, laptop balanced on her knees, hair still damp from the ice bath. She is running the logistics of the life we built. Yeye is at the counter, filming content with a precision that makes simple food look like high art. A new girl wipes down the gym floor without being asked, learning the hierarchy through action, not explanation.
Nobody is pretending. Nobody is performing. That’s what rhythm feels like—effort so consistent it becomes invisible.
Dubai was the crucible.
This city doesn’t do half-measures. It punishes hesitation and rewards architecture. You either build here, or you serve here. It is a place that looked at the burning desert and said, “We will force this to yield.”
That same philosophy runs through the blood of this house.
Outsiders look at this life and call it intense. They see the structure and call it controlling. They see the discipline and call it cold. They want to know if everyone is "happy."
But they mistake happiness for comfort.
They think a soft sofa and a safe life constitute happiness. They are wrong. Comfort is not happiness; comfort is merely anesthesia. It is the absence of pain.
Real happiness is Purpose.
And purpose is derived directly from the logic we discussed: the Prime Directive. For the masculine, there is no joy in safety. There is no fulfillment in stagnation. True happiness only exists when you are aligned with the logic of Species Expansion—when you are building, protecting, and extending the line.
We realised long ago that you cannot build a dynasty on feelings. You build it on biology. You build it on the cold, hard math of survival. The world outside is eating its own seed corn, trading its future for a little bit of comfort today. Inside these walls, we guard the harvest.
The children are the measure.
They are the audit of everything I believe.
They rise early. They train before they eat. They read before they play. They speak two languages by ten and understand the law of respect before they know how to spell it. They bow to their mothers, they wrestle with their fathers, and they understand that comfort is a privilege, not a right.
Each mother carries a different strength—softness, steel, patience, aesthetic. Each child draws what they need from the right source. It isn’t "co-parenting." It is a clan.
Some days I am the fire that pushes them. Some days I am the wall that protects them. But I am always the Standard.
We built the Ark. We filled it with life. And now, we just let it sail.
I told you earlier that I view God as the Source Code—the architecture of the universe. But code needs an operating system to run on.
For most of my life, I resisted this. I wore rebellion like armor. Institutions bored me. Religion felt like a leash. But when you start building a real-world dynasty, you hit a truth that the "Ghost in the Machine" demands: structure needs ritual.
You can’t just run a family like a business. You need an ethic that lives under the concrete.
So I looked at the world’s operating systems. I looked at what survived.
In Islam, despite my concerns about extremist immigration policies in the UK and a push for Sharia Law, there is an undeniable power in the software. It understands family. It understands discipline. It understands that a man must lead and a woman must be protected. It is unapologetically ordered. It has hierarchy, devotion, ritual, and rhythm.
It aligns perfectly with the Prime Directive of Species Expansion. It works.
So I took what fit. The law. The discipline. The unity.
And I merged it with the British steel I was raised with: wit, stoicism, quiet pride, and the individual responsibility to hold your ground.
What came out the other side wasn’t religion. It was Synthesis.
A fusion of East and West. Faith without fanaticism. Order without oppression. Devotion without delusion. A new blueprint that honours tradition but refuses to be trapped by it.
I’m not trying to blend in. I’m building something that lasts where I stand. A house that aligns with the land it’s built on, but still speaks the language of where I came from.
Not Islam. Not Britain. A law of my own, informed by both.
Britain still hurts to think about. I love it like a son loves a parent that stopped trying. It is a culture that traded courage for comfort, strength for slogans, and truth for tolerance.
Softness became policy. Masculinity became taboo. Family became optional. And into that vacuum, stronger cultures stepped. Not better, just more disciplined. Nature doesn’t do guilt—it rewards order. You can’t blame them for winning.
I stopped mourning it years ago. You can’t revive a nation that’s allergic to its own spine.
So I took the best of it—the humor, the resilience, the unspoken code of not making a fuss—and I brought it here. Adaptation is not betrayal. It’s survival done properly.
Maybe one day I’ll return to my homeland and get into politics. They can reference this book and try to cancel me, and I’ll own it like a medal. But for now, the work is here.
When I walk through the villa and see the women at peace, the children training, and the system operating, I know: this is the version of civilisation I wanted to live in. Not an idea. A functioning model.
The house doesn’t need me to speak anymore. It moves because the rhythm is baked into the walls.
That’s when you know you’ve built properly—when it breathes without your breath.
Writing this book felt the same. No muse. No manic inspiration. Just slow structure. Voice notes at midnight. Pages rewritten ten times. Brutal edits. Eventually, the code surfaced.
The same law that runs the house. The same one that raised me. The one that keeps moving when I stop.

Lessons for My Sons
Boys, the world will try to soften you with smiles. Don’t let it.
You’ll be tested by chaos disguised as love, comfort disguised as opportunity, weakness disguised as kindness. Your job isn’t to avoid the storm—it’s to become the mountain it breaks against.
Train your nervous system like it’s armor.
Cold. Silence. Hunger.
Lead with rhythm, not noise. Speak little, act exact.
When a woman follows your lead, honour it.
When she doesn’t, release her.
Devotion cannot be forced—it can only be earned through consistency.
Be the man whose word is enough.
Your legacy is not your bloodline. It’s your standard in motion.

To Future Generations
If you are reading this in 2100, look up. Go outside. Stand in the wind.
The screen is a cage. The algorithm is a leash. Do not trust them. The wind is real. The dirt is real. Your blood is real.
I built this for you, but I did not build it to keep you comfortable. I built it to make you dangerous.
I didn’t just leave you capital; capital burns. I left you a Framework.
You grew up in rhythm while the rest of the world drowned in noise. You speak truth because you were never taught to lie. You treat strength as hygiene—something you wash with every day—not a performance you put on for applause.
You inherit this system, but you do not worship it. You refine it.
Be better than me where I was blind. Be colder than me where I was weak. Where I hesitated, strike.
Lead like it is instinct. Lead like the world depends on your spine, because it likely does.
Protect the name. Expand the Law.
Build not just wealth, but weight.

Letter to My Mother
Mum,
You were the first woman I ever loved, and you remain the last woman to inspire such awe in me. Not from a place of weakness or caution, but with the profound reverence a strong son holds for a powerful mother: a complex knot of respect, fear, and honour, a bond that never truly unravels.
You have been my anchor more times than I can count. When discipline was needed, you delivered it without hesitation. You stood firm when others would have folded. You called me out when no one else had the courage. You never let me bluff my way past you.
When I got in trouble, you showed up. When I pushed boundaries, you didn’t shield me from consequence, you corrected me. Not with softness, but with discipline. And that discipline built my spine. You grounded me when I fought. You scolded me when I strayed. You always held me to a standard even higher than I held for myself. That’s what real parenting is.
I know this book might be difficult for you to read. I know parts may sting, because I’ve chosen beliefs you don’t share, and forged a path you would never walk. But please know this, none of it is a rejection of you. It is an extension.
You raised a son who thinks for himself, who acts boldly, who isn’t afraid to take risks or stand for something he believes in. Even though we disagree, especially about family, especially about structure, I want you to see this clearly: this isn’t about women, or control, or sex. It’s about legacy. It’s about honouring the values you embedded in me: strength, clarity, responsibility, sacrifice.
You worked your way up in a world that didn’t want to make space for women like you, and you won. You never complained. You never collapsed. You figured it out and you forged a path. That same fire lives in me. You taught me never to waste my life. Never to soften. Never to make excuses.
I know you dreamed of something more traditional for me, a wife, a wedding, a white picket fence. I hope, with time, you’ll see that what I’m building is something greater. Not better. Not lesser. Just different. Larger. A tribe. A dynasty. A living extension of what came before, and everything I still have to give.
I want you to see the children. The joy. The rhythm. I want you to see the strength I’m pouring into the next generation, the strength you gave me.
And when that day comes, when you walk into the home I’ve built and see many children who came from your line, all bound together by values you forged, I hope you’ll finally understand.
Your son,
Spencer
